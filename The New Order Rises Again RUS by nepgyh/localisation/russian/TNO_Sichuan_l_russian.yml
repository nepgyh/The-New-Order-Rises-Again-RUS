Бесчисленное количество молодых людей было призвано на защиту Китая, и провинция сплотилась вокруг Чан Кайши и республиканского знамени. Все было напрасно. К 1947 году Императорская армия Японии разгромила их провинцию, опустошив и землю, и людей. Наконец, в 1949 году она перестала находиться под военным управлением и была передана Тину Чунь-яо.
