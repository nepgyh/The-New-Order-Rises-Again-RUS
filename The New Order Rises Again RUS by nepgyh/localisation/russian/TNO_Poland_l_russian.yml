 #Leader Descriptions#
 POLITICS_KAZIMIERZ_SOSNKOWSKI_DESC:0 "Казимеж Соснковский, известный под псевдонимом "The Poet", the last leader of Polish Government-in-Exile, never entertained the dastardly thought of surrender even after the successful German invasion of Britain seemed to crush any remaining hopes of an allied victory. Using the chaos of the turbulent '50s he managed to smuggle himself through Brittany, to France and Italy, from which somehow he managed to reach the Generalgouvernement. Many conspiracy theories suggests that it was possibly one of many Mussolini's "last gifts" to Germany before his demise.\n\nThanks to Hans Frank's delusions and incompetence, the structure of the Home Army remained largely intact, so Sosnkowski was able to use his abilities to rebuild the formation and the structure of the Polish Underground State. Structural weakness in the German economy and a pyrrhic victory against the Western Russian Revolutionary Front allowed for massive expansion of underground structures, including a taxation system, courts, welfare, police, press, and education, all miraculously kept in secret. In the early '60s it became a state within a state, as every formal structure of the Generalgouvernement was subverted. However, the Home Army was not yet ready to rise up as the German garrison was still impossible to defeat with likely support from Germania. The start of the German Civil War however changed the situation and convinced Sosnkowski to begin a general uprising. He has become an old man, his health degrading with one suffered stroke, almost going blind – but the dream of finally liberating his homeland keeps him alive.\n\nAs a person, Kazimierz Sosnkowski is a truly man of renaissance, knowing French, English, German, Russian, Italian, classical Greek and Latin, while mastering piano, chess, painting, hunting, football and horse riding. Maybe in a different time and place he would have been a renown intellectual and translator of poetry. But for Kazimierz Sosnkowski, those hobbies were nothing to Poland's freedom from the harsh grip of the German yoke. Indulgence comes after sacrifice after all."
