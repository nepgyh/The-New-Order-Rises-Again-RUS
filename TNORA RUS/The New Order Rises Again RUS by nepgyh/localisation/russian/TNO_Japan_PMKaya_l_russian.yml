###KAYA INITIAL TREE###
 JAP_kaya_time:0 "Prime Minister Kaya"
 JAP_kaya_time_desc:0 "With Kaya at the helm of Japan itself, one can expect much change under his administration. A former Reform Bureaucrat turned Prime Minister, Kaya harbors ambitions to deal with the various factors preventing Japan from reaching its maximum potential.\n\nFrom the conflict between the Zaibatsus and Keiretsus and the interservice rivalry between the Army and Navy, Kaya plans to end the discord, one way or another. His final plan is synthesizing the government, military, and industry into one cohesive unit after settling their individual disputes, all to redirect their efforts to serve Japan, first and foremost.\n\nWhether it requires stripping power from the various companies, mending the divide in both departments of the armed forces, or cleansing his cabinet of uncooperative members, Kaya will ensure that he and his Reform Bureaucrats get what they desire, no matter the cost."
 JAP_the_new_cabinet:0 "The New Cabinet"
 JAP_the_new_cabinet_desc:0 "The first task of any new Prime Minister is to form a new cabinet. Close associates and talented individuals alike will be selected and week-long discussions shall be held to understand the position we've been placed in.\n\nWe must act quickly to garner support and root ourselves in Japanese politics, as the other factions of the Yokusankai look down on our fledgling government with disdain in their eyes. Should we show any vulnerability, they will decimate us without hesistation.\n\nOur Emperor has given us a chance, but they will not. We shall prove the vultures wrong."

 JAP_appeal_to_the_hardliners_desc:0 "As Kaya was elected as the new Prime Minister, his foundations and support started off as frail. So until he can push for major reforms to satisfy his campaign's promises, he is forced to seek out aid quickly to ensure temporary stability in his position.\n\nOne potential group of backers are the hardline members of the cabinet, who are well acquainted with Kaya on ideological and personal levels. With their deep pockets and web of connections, they could surely assist Kaya and allow him to continue operating as Prime Minister, for a price that is.\n\nTheir only condition is to place Teiichi Suzuki, a renowned economist, a seat at the Diet with the role as the Minister of Economy. His methods are unorthodox indeed, but they have been used to good use in Guangdong and shall be put into greater usage under Kaya's guidance.\n\nThough such a request is monumental, this slight boost is what's needed to keep Kaya from sinking under the pressure of the Yokusankai. After the deal is brokered and having support under his belt, Kaya can finally soon reform Japan at his behest."
 JAP_rub_our_back:0 "Rub our Back..."
 JAP_rub_our_back_desc:0 "To win over the hardliners' trust, we must extoll to them their benefits if they do decide to cooperate with us. Political favors, landed appointments, extra seats, the list goes on. We shall arrange deals at first in secret with several prominent figures, then slowly, little by little, we will eventually receive a cascade of deals, to which then we will garner enough support to wade through the murky depths of the Yokusankai.\n\n§RThe problem is, are we sure we can follow through? What if it's too much? What if we come up short? What will their reactions be?§!\n\n§YRegardless, we must keep our chins held high and be open to further talks.§!"

 JAP_and_we_will_rub_yours_desc:0 "Now that we have received an ample amount of offers, we shall begin to fulfill them. Shifting through their signed letters, most of the requests are small and easily grantable. As previously mentioned, we have outlined what we can do for them, and many have taken that to heart.\n\nHowever, a looming problem remains in several individuals, who, while influential, have asked for demands as large as their power in the political sphere. Accepting these demands ensures we get substantial backing amongst the Diet, but at the expense of the support from the public.\n\n§RIt hurts us to do it, but our position as the leading group is more important than the desires of the people.§!"

 JAP_a_new_face_desc:0 "After Teiichi Suzuki is inaugurated as the new Minister of Economy, he has to settle in and learn the ropes of the Diet in order to become an effective servant to the cabinet.\n\nWith a few weeks of service, he'll surely adapt to his new position and feel comfortable handling the day-to-day operations. That said, we shall also ensure his old position back in Guangdong is replaced by a suitable candidate, so his years of administration and organization aren't wasted.\n\nWe are glad to have Suzuki aboard and wish him for his future successes well."

 JAP_deal_with_the_devil_scripted:0 "We have finally achieved our goal. After weeks of tiring negotiations and granting countless concessions, we have coerced the hardliners to support our cause. However, there is one thing left for us to accomplish. We must convene with the Showa No Yokai himself, and receive his ultimate approval.\n\nWhile Kishi has expressed support, he wishes to see the fruits of our labor. Once we show him the signed documents, he will most likely laugh heartily, and express his executive decision with a thumbs-up. §WThat is, if he doesn't request anything else.§!\n\n§YIf he does, that will be the final deciding factor. If we fail it, our work will be for naught, and the Reform Bureaucrats will be left to the hungry wolves, ready to dismember and devour wholeheartedly.§!\n\n§RLastly, remember that there is no return. It is either we comply and receive Lucifer's grace, or succumb to the fiery hell we find ourselves in.§!"

We shall not revise our reforms or give concessions to appease our rivals.\n\nOur party is not to be trifled with. Our plans are not to be interrupted. Our ideas are not to be denounced. We are the ones in control. We shall not give in to those who oppose us. We were elected for a reason. It is our right to lead this nation and guide it to victory.\n\nWe shall spearhead the rejuvenation of Japan and its people, all on our own."

 JAP_forge_our_own_path_desc:0 "To listen to the devil's temptations? Foolish. To seek aid from our rivals? Never. The path to victory must be one paved by the work of one's own hands.\n\nAfter discerning all possible options, it seems the only way is to go forward, alone. While this may take significant amounts of effort, Prime Minister Okinori Kaya is prepared to handle the strenuous and arduous tasks laying ahead. Such tasks include extensive reforms promised during the campaigns, and exemplary acts of leadership in the party.\n\nOnce this is complete however, the Reform Bureaucrats shall stand empowered and unyielding, now free to develop Japan for the betterment of the people."

We shall react to the concerns immediately and resolve them as quickly as possible.\n\nThe faster we're able to solve them, the more the populace notices our hardworking nature and may show support for us, allowing our popularity to rise. With the people's backing, we are able to pass our intended reforms without bars or restrictions."
 JAP_leading_by_example:0 "Leading by Example"
 JAP_leading_by_example_desc:0 "An effective leader works alongside his team,inspiring them to emulate his hardworking nature rather than commanding them to do his bidding. We shall prove that our gracious Prime Minister Kaya, is not above working, spending his precious effort and time toiling tirelessly alongside his accolades to solve the rampant problems ravaging Japan.\n\nBy showing his virtuous ethics, many will become convinced and vouch and support a government with such a responsible leader, increasing our popularity."
 JAP_rule_by_our_view_or_none:0 "Rule By Our View Or None"
 JAP_rule_by_our_view_or_none_desc:0 "After all we've done to enlighten the bureaucrats by the ingenuity of our ideas, some refuse to listen and cover their ears to our words of wisdom.\n\nHowever, we shall announce to them this; those that defy our orders shall receive two choices: adhere to our political thought and live peacefully under our tenure, or a simple disappearance from society completely, all records removed and contacts cut.\n\nWith a choice like that, it surely will motivate people to choose the former, and soon, all of Japan will stand ideologically united."
 JAP_realpolitik:0 "Realpolitik"
 JAP_realpolitik_desc:0 "Due to our current standings, the best course of action in order to stabilize our position has been determined: negotiate some compromises and give concessions to influential former candidates like Ikeda and Kido in exchange for support, in order for our reforms to pass smoothly without resistance.\n\nHowever, by giving in to our rivals, it may stunt our growth in the short run, yet, it is necessary for us to continue for the long term. Our time in the Diet has not been long, but if we want to continue staying in the ring, we must work and ally with the ones who can knock us out of it."
 JAP_talk_with_ikeda:0 "Talk with Ikeda"
 JAP_talk_with_ikeda_desc:0 "Ikeda is a simple man, a man who desires nothing more than to uphold the status quo and the continued stability of Japan. As such, we can use this to our benefit by appealing to his more tender sides to convince him to aid our cause.\n\nWe shall first arrange a meeting with him to discuss agreeable terms, granted we gain his support. We must be ready, as Ikeda wants to curb the military's prominence in government affairs and may try something to ensure that our armed force's influence is reduced.\n\nWhile it will be impossible to accept his full demands due to conflicting interests, we can compromise and hopefully reach an agreement which allows both parties to gain something out of the exchange. If our desired outcome is achieved, plans to advance to our next phase may begin."
 JAP_listen_with_kido:0 "Listen with Kido"
 JAP_listen_with_kido_desc:0 "Kido is a powerful ally to have, as shown by his status as MP. While wielding vast influence among the House of Peers, he looks down on the House of Representatives, eyeing us with disdain. Regardless, his assistance is required.\n\nWe shall schedule a meeting with him to discuss the measures needed to gain his backing. With this however, we must be keen and keep our wits about us, as Kido is cunning and will conjure an elaborate scheme to tip the deal in his favor. Knowing this, all possibilities must be considered and preparations are necessary. However, if we do manage to secure a favorable deal, it will boost our progress significantly, allowing for us to shift to the next stage in our plans."
 JAP_bend_to_pressure:0 "Bend to Pressure"
 JAP_bend_to_pressure_desc:0 "Right now, we hold no position to enforce total control over the government so in order to stabilize it, we must turn to the system we try to avoid - the Kokutai. We must adhere to its rules strictly to appease the upper house, in doing so may make them content with our rule. Alongside that, caving in to public demands and passing reforms drafted by important officials will allow us to earn some support.\n\nSuch methods definitely get the job done and provide us a temporary boost we'll need to start off with, but many suggest this strategy may stunt our future growth. Unfortunately we have no choice, as it's the most logical path we can pursue."

 JAP_pragmatism_reigns_supreme_desc:0 "Ever since our negotiations, our government's stability has been restored and our coalition is now able to traverse the raging waters of the Yokusankai.\n\nThe time has come to start enacting plans of our own volition, and achieve the goals so long promised before taking power. With the backing and support of some influential politicians, we now have the necessary credibility to pull off our plans without much interference.\n\nWe shall slowly work our way upwards, reform after reform, until our efforts pay off and our objectives are achieved. Under our rule, Japan's rise will be dizzying."

 JAP_begin_the_reforms_desc:0 "Now that we have survived the preliminaries, the time has come to move onto the main event - the implementation of our reforms and policies.\n\nWe can tackle the many problems that surround our society, hindering us from moving forward; from the twisting corridors of the Diet, to the organized barracks of the military, to the sprawling suburbs and secluded villages of Japan and the Sphere; all shall be reformed and developed under our administration.\n\nWe will clear away the vines binding Japan to complacency and stagnation. We will burn them away from the roots until Japan is unshackled, its glory dwarfing that of the Goliaths of the West."
 JAP_intergrate_the_military:0 "Integrate the Military"
 JAP_intergrate_the_military_desc:0 "Since the Meiji Restoration, the military has been closely intertwined with the state, waging conflicts for the interests of the directive above, yet our loyal officers never felt formally welcomed in Diet halls for years, up until this point.\n\nToday marks that day, where we begin our grand project of increasing military partnership with the government to an all-time high. Talks between the General Staff will begin to occur, with discussions for possible benefits in exchange for collaboration."
 JAP_court_the_generals:0 "Court the Generals"
 JAP_court_the_generals_desc:0 "The Imperial Army has had an intimate relationship in Japanese politics for years, with many dignified officers holding positions and influence in the government; As such, having their backing would be a massive boon. That being said, even if they support our ideals whole-heartedly, they are skeptical of our intentions and so further diplomatic actions must be taken to earn their trust. We shall set an appointment with them to convince them that our motivations are pure which will allow us to earn their trust."
 JAP_dine_with_admirals:0 "Dine with Admirals"
 JAP_dine_with_admirals_desc:0 "While the Imperial Navy spends most of its time engaging in overseas affairs rather than participating in home politics, its staff still command some degree of prestige and influence, so garnering their support would serve our best interests. However, the navy is a gentry bunch, so to lull them over, would require exquisite dinners with influential officers and some charismatic persuasion to convince them to aid us. Once we've secured their support, it'll be smooth sailing from there."

 JAP_the_civilians_will_learn_desc:0 "Serving in the military can teach many vital lessons to the average citizen, however, as it stands now, the draft only calls for so little.\n\nWe shall revise this law to enable high conscriptions requirements. Doing so, will boost the amount of soldiers we can field. However, many of our advisors warn that diverting manpower to the military means all other sectors will be affected as well and in general, many will see this move as controversial and protest its approval.\n\nClearly, they are all too spineless. Do they not see the threat of the Americans landing on our soil uncontested, due to the shortage of men? They are all mistaken. The law shall pass."

 JAP_the_might_of_our_military_desc:0 "The military's role in Japan has been severely downplayed these past years, from the foray into the plains of China, to the high sea engagements and intense island hopping skirmishes against America, our loyal soldiers have always been there, risking their lives for the sovereignty of the Japanese people and the salvation of the nation.\n\nWith the withstanding peace we've experienced, the army's been on standby, save for small divisions and fleets to safeguard our interests abroad. Many people, especially the younger generation, question their usefulness and push for the reduction of their spending and mitigation of their grasp on power.\n\nHowever, the youths weren't there. They weren't born when Japan was threatened with extinction. They didn't serve or see the effort and dedication that our brave men put in, putting themselves on the line and even sacrificing themselves, all so that our glorious Sun may not be extinguished.\n\nWe shall show the new generations that the service of these brave warriors is necessary, more than ever in the tumultuous world. We shall prove that our armed forces are the bastion against the West, and that our glorious defenders are here to stay, forever and ever."

We shall start the cleansing by sacking notorious or underperforming cabinet members to terrorize the rest to reveal themselves, lest they want to suffer even worse consequences.\n\nSoon, the rodents hiding in the cracks will be delivered into the cat's paws, ready to be devoured."

What better way to do so than invoke one of Japan's most sacred principles, the Kokutai?\n\nFor years, the decadent Prime Ministers have allowed Japan to deteriorate and weaken. This has culminated in the utter failure of Hiroya Ino, whose administration was bout with corruption and his resignation left Japan dealing with utter economic destruction and in deep bureaucratic chaos.\n\nWith such a catastrophic failure, it will be easy to exploit this and state that we, the Reform Bureaucrats, intend to uphold and protect the values of the Kokutai previous leaders have not. Where our predecessors have failed, we shall succeed."

Knock the wrong man or two, and the whole system falls apart.\n\nThat is why, with careful planning, we must have excellent staffing to work in tandem with our operations. We must devote more resources into our police department, be it new textbooks or better equipment, to ensure our officers can perform at the highest efficiency.\n\n§YWhile the funding of this renewal might be costly, our contacts in the hardline Reform Bureaucrats are more than willing to cover the cost.§!"

However, some of these men are intertwined with Prime Minister Kaya himself. Back during the days of Prime Minister Konoe, several of these individuals worked alongside Kaya in the Shōwa Kenyōkai, the predecessor of today's think tank. However, those liberals opposed Kaya's ideals and plans, actively criticizing them in favor of their own.\n\nOld scars don't heal, and while Kaya doesn't hold personal grudges, he holds distaste for those who disagree with his agenda."

However, despite demands for the reversal of these actions, none are powerful enough to stop it at the slightest.\n\nWith foresight, Kaya has ensured maximum protection through his connections with Prince Takeda. While the Peers may sneer and growl, they can only look on as they have a leash called blackmail, tightly secured around their necks.\n\nNow left unchecked and unshackled, Kaya can freely move through the Diet and integrate any opposition into his apparatus without repercussions."

It shows them business is meant and that we aren't afraid to assert authority through any means necessary.\n\nWith this, they will be wary of contesting our government, though another crackdown at this massive scale may be more devastating than beneficial for us.

However, with the development of the stock market crash and their subsequent full-scale conflict that followed, the situation presents a unique opportunity.\n\nWe shall make our opening moves by increasing their tax burdens, probing their strength while slowly funneling our rightful funds back into the state treasury. Once the ploy is realized, the Zaibatsus and Keiretsus will try calling us out, yet no real action is taken because of the economic strains they suffer currently.\n\nThis first step will bring us closer to the reduction and minimization of their influence and power, ending their misguided rule on our economy."

Worse, they cannot be reasoned with, prioritizing every unit of yen rather than the goodwill of the people.\n\nThey are mighty, but as evidenced by Yasuda, are overstretched and overextended, leaving them fragile and teetering on collapse.

We must act quickly while the Kerietsus are akin to mere fledglings, and strike them down before they develop and mature into the colossal conglomerates the Zaibatsus are.\n\nSince they are smaller in scale, tactics unusable on the Zaibatsu are viable for use against them.

However, my inauguration comes at a perilous hour. The recent crisis, caused by former Prime Minister Ino Hiroya's ineffectiveness, still lingers in Japanese society, affecting countless lives.\n\nBesides that, we are surrounded. From the West, the Germans inch ever closer, and from the East, the United States encroaches on our oceans. At this rate, the Rising Sun will be snuffed out if no further action is taken.\n\nThat is why under my tenure, I vow Japan shall be rebuilt from the ground up. From the officer's headquarters, to the Diet's halls, to the corporation's boardrooms, reform will be assured, one way or another.\n\nFinally, once Japan has been transformed, we shall be able to contest once more the superpower status the Reich and the States claim. Before long, Germania and Washington D.C shall quake in fear of the Emperor's might.\n\nWe cannot be complacent. The task ahead of us will be an arduous one, and an uphill battle. This is why I ask you, the loyal deputies of Japan, to assist my cause. Please, provide the foundation upon which we shall construct a better Japan. Without your support, what I plan to do shall fail, and if I cannot enact my changes, then Japan truly cannot be saved."\n\nKaya bowed, and began to walk back. From the stillness, a thousand voices rose in unison. Conversation raged furiously, with questions being raised. Kaya kept walking, and promised himself he'd give the detractors an answer in due time."

As he was about to turn it, there was a single, hard knock. And before Kaya could muster a response, it swung open.\n\nBacking away, Kaya found himself face to face with his guest. Line ran throughout their face, from forehead down to cheeks. Their graying hair seemed to glow in the dim room. Lastly, their mouth was curled into a wide grin.\n\n"Hello Kaya, or should I say Prime Minister Kaya?" said Kishi, chuckling at his jest. "Sorry. I was running a few errands and completely forgot about this meeting." said Kishi as he stretched back on his chair.\n\nKaya nodded, but he would've preferred a sincere apology.

Think about it hard Kaya. This is an exclusive offer I make to you now. There are no strings attached to this either."\n\nKaya pondered. On one hand, Kishi was a very influential man. He could certainly back up his words and aid Kaya significantly. On the other hand, Kishi's motives remained a mystery. His words merely an upfront for something more malicious. Without indication, Kaya could be falling victim to one of his schemes. Kaya had to discern wisely.\n\nA handshake and a pat on the back later, the deal was done. "Excellent choice, Kaya.

Then, his eyes turned to something else. On the right, in a tiny gazebo overlooking the massive pond, sat someone.\n\n"Kishi-sama said you needed my help?" said Takeda, sipping on his sake, his medals gleaming in the dim light.\n\n"I do. What can I do to gain your help?" said Kaya.\n\nTakeda passed a cup to Kaya and smiled. "Have a drink first, please."\n\nKaya grabbed it, drinking it fully. "What can you do for my help?" mused Takeda. "Ah, I know. The Imperial coffers have been looking dry lately. Could you direct some funds there? Alongside that, I need some better opportunities for business in Manchuria. Startups don't grow money by themselves. They'll need a little push." said Takeda, chuckling.\n\nKaya quietly grumbled.

Both men stood, ready to claw at each other's necks. While they only shared a moment of silence, it felt like an eternity.\n\nThen, a few conceding words ended their stalemate. "I'll deliver the funds to you shortly. In return, I expect your assistance later on." said Kaya, turning away.\n\n"Of course, how can such kindness be rewarded dutifully?" scoffed Takeda.

You've heard the story before, so let's move on."\n\n"Indeed, but please be earlier." said Kaya, tightly clenching his pen.\n\n"Every matter has been arranged. Anything you'll need is prepared and ready for your usage. However, I have a small favor for you." said Kishi, rising from his seat. He inched closer to Kaya, then bent down and whispered into his ear. "Remove Satoshi Akao from the position of Deputy Prime Minister. He is inexperienced, and frankly, an ideological threat." said Kishi, slipping an enclosed envelope to Kaya. Opening it, Kaya saw evidence to prove Kishi's statement. "You see, he affiliates with a group called the "Nagoya Anarchists." I wouldn't ever have someone like that serving for me, let alone in the government." remarked Kishi.\n\n"Why? Akao has not done anything wrong so far." said Kaya. "Besides, who will replace him?"\n\n"Me." said Kishi, grinning from ear to ear. "But don't announce that publicly. I don't want to deal with a whirlwind of press."\n\nAt this moment, the pen held in Kaya's hand snapped. The feelings of exasperation had been building up ever since the meeting started. Whether it was Kishi's posturing or his snarky attitude, Kaya did not know. Next he felt a wave of anger wash over him. And there was only one way he could channel it.\n\n"Kishi. I don't appreciate you simply discarding people like that. While I understand he is a risk, he hasn't shown any signs of incompetence or ideological impasse. I suggest you end your attempts to appoint him. Now." said Kaya, glaring at Kishi with a rising tone in his voice.\n\n"My, my, dear Kaya.

Acting impetuously will see both of our bodies in some sideway alley. We mustn't let them catch wind of our plans. For now, we must gather some allies of our own."\n\n"Alright, but who will be willing to aid us?"\n\n"Several high-ranking officers still owe me some favors, and surely your status as Rear Admiral will be enough to enlist some on your side."\n\n"Sounds good." said Takagi.\n\n"Kido nodded, then recited a famous proverb in his noble tongue of kanbun:"

Besides that, we'll be receiving reliable backing, providing us with great insurance among the Diet." finished Satoshi.\n\nKaya shook his head in disagreement. "That's the thing. If we do collaborate, chances are they'll gain more from us more than we out of them. Remember, we may be a small fish in the big ocean, but we don't want to end up as their bottom feeders." said Kaya, grabbing a piece of paper and jolting something down. "Here." said Kaya, passing the sheet to Satoshi, "I've written down notable people who we can persuade to join us. Work with the rest of the cabinet in seeking these individuals out, alright?" requested Kaya.\n\n"Alright, let's see. Etsusaburo Shiina, Masanosuke Ikeda..." said Satoshi, his eyes scanning through the names. "Are you confident all of them could be convinced to help us?" said Satoshi, gazing back to Kaya. Kaya nodded, and assured him with a firm nod.\n\n"I see. In that case, we'll reach out to them, then report back as soon as possible." said Satoshi, bowing alongside the others. Shutting the door behind them, Satoshi's group now set off.\n\nThe hall outside was subjected to a plethora of sounds. Shoes squeaking against the polished marble, while the chatter of voices reverberated off the walls. Each member prepared accordingly, then split off. From four to three, three to two, two to one, and one to none. The once bellowing corridor now laid empty, and silence pranced around where the men had once been."

He had done little to win them over during his campaign for leadership; nor had he done anything to appease them since then. In many ways, the peers were only meeting him in hopes that he could be talked out of making further reforms. So far, he had expressed no sign of wishing to do so.\n\n"My lords, I have gathered you here to meet with me for a very simple reason. I wish to bring you news of things to come. During these next months, I intend to maximize the efficiency of this nation by whatever means necessary. The lingering traces of the old conservative government will be stripped away from the state and replaced. This is to be the beginning of a new era of Japanese politics. "\n\nKaya's brashness about his mandate was cause for great bewilderment among the Kazoku. Yet the Prime Minister was still not done.\n\n"There is a place for you all in this new system. Your support, connections and resources will be of great value to the government. I have no intention of making you my enemies. However, should you prove to be an obstacle, then I can assure that you will be swept away. There can be no place for resistance in the new Japanese state. In the near future, I ask that you all remember my words. It may be greatly beneficial for you to do so"\n\nBefore the Peers could object, Kaya departed from the table.

Many of them smoked cigarettes, and with looks of painful dread on their face they remained silent in anticipating the conversation about their cause of concern.\n\nOne of the generals cleared his throat with a raspy cough, and gathered his colleagues' attention. He rolled his shoulders to ease his tension, and began to speak with an intense whisper, masking his words so only those in the room could hear.\n\n"I've seen it far too often recently... Kishi, that monster; everywhere he goes, people disappear. He breathes down the Prime Minister's neck, whispering him sweet lies and daring threats. He is the Devil of Showa."\n\nThe men surrounding him nodded and murmured in agreement, putting out their cigarettes to divert their full attention to the conversation. They made comments supporting his claims; some of the officers noted Kishi's unwanted presence in and around IJA offices, as well as his ghostly charm around the disappearances of certain members of staff. The men gulped, and with each claim made they had begun to realize the extent of the devil's reach across the dark corners of the empire."

He quickly looked down and slightly unbuttoned his drenched uniform to allow some air to circulate and cool his chest. Moto then looked back up and found himself staring face-to-face with his scowling drill instructor, Sergeant Reo.\n\n"Not paying attention, Private Moto? Undisciplined scoundrels like you deserve punishment... FIVE LAPS! NOW!" shouted Reo, swinging his staff at Moto's thigh. With a yelp, Moto began his second jog of the day.\n\nFinishing the final lap, Moto exhaustedly collapsed onto the grass. His vision blurred, colors turning monochrome. His hearing waned, as ringing overtook all noise. He wanted to call for help. He wanted to vomit. He couldn't do anything but watch as his world faded into black.\n\nA wave of cold water suddenly splashed his face. "Get up Private Moto! Practice starts soon!" yelled Sergeant Reo. "Here is your rifle. Make sure it doesn't break." said Reo. Moto only responded with a weak salute. As he looked down at the rifle however, he noticed something off.\n\n"Sergeant Reo. The rifle you gave me is defective." said Moto.\n\nHearing this, Reo stopped distributing the other soldier's rifles, pivoted around and stomped furiously until he faced Moto. He was fed up with Moto's behavior. He was ready to scream his lungs out. He was ready to send him to hell and back. As he raised his hand to slap Moto, Reo noticed the rifle he was carrying. It was significantly shorter than the rest of the guns issued alongside it. Its metal work seemed sloppy and unpolished, while the wooden frame splintered in several edges. Such poor quality, Reo imagined, would only be produced somewhere in a foreign sweatshop twenty years ago, during the war.\n\n"Everyone stay in position! Don't use your firearms in any circumstance!" ordered Sergeant Reo. He eyed the shoddy rifle with disdain as he marched off with it to the local mechanic."

To access the walkway they would move across while touring the facility, the inspectors and their guide were forced to climb a great number of stairs. The military inspectors could not help but notice how rusted most of the metal around the plant looked, especially on the very stairs they climbed. Upon finally reaching the top, the manager was keen to point out just how impressive the view was from up high. Far below, the plant's hundreds of workers were busy preparing ammunition at various stages of completion.\n\n"How Many hours do your staff work here each day?"\n\n"Ah yes, well due to the recent demand increases, most of our workers are here for around ten to twelve hours. That includes their break time."\n\nAt ground level, it became clear that rust and long hours were only some of the many problems. Within seconds, the inspectors noticed failing equipment, broken safetywear and even a few decades-old munition assembly machines. Closer inspection made it apparent that even the fully functional tools were quite old.\n\n"How are staff provided safety equipment here?"\n\n"Anything they break must be replaced out of their own salary"\n\nThe inspectors had nothing but concerned looks for the rest of the tour."

Witnessing the fierce resistance to his agendas for himself, and the Prime Minister's excellent taming of the opposition to pass his bills, Kishi could only extend his arm and pride Kaya for controlling such wicked crowds. With a sinister grin, the powerful man nodded to the Prime Minister, before relaxing in a chair just opposite him.\n\n"You have brought much justice to our cause, Mr. Kaya. The Yokusankai is far more powerful than it has ever been. Of course, the factions have their uses, but their petty squabbles far remove them from what really matters - the premiership."\n\nKaya, intimidated by Kishi, nodded profusely and suppressed any sign of fear beneath a forced grin. Even as in his position, he could not afford to displease the man with the devilish smile, the Prime Minister thought. After all, he had seen what Kishi had done to people who had crossed him.\n\n"Yes, of course Mr. Kishi, the premiership. It is simply the most integral position to bring about change in the nation. The Reform Bureaucrats have really encouraged positive change across the empire, and I am so proud to sit in this seat representing that interest-"\n\n"Yes," Kishi sneered and he turned his nose up at the Prime Minister.

He nodded back at Takagi, confirming the outrageous statements.\n\n"Not only that, but he's using the Prime Minister to implement his policies whilst escaping public backlash. Kaya's being used, whether he knows it or not, by the sly bastard to cover his tracks. He's a danger, and the more time he's allowed to scurry about in the shadows, the more influential he'll get."\n\nBoth worried, they discussed their next moves to approach the threat Kishi posed to the nation. They came to the conclusion that they should inform the leaders of other trustworthy cliques in the Taisei Yokusankai, with the aim of unraveling this great plot that could potentially plunge the empire into civil unrest and militaristic tyranny."

In the simply decorated room, a feeling of coldness and distrust had set over the three politicians.\n\nSoukichi Takagi was the first to propose an alliance between their cliques in the upper and lower houses of the Diet, as a united opposition to Prime Minister Kaya. The retired admiral expected a modicum of agreement for his proposal from Ikeda and Kido, but the two were curt and dismissive of his plans. The rift between them all would be near impossible to bridge, especially Kido, the ever-scheming visionary. Were it not for his friends in the Kazoku, he would have fallen from grace long ago.\n\nAnd as for Ikeda? He had refused to agree with any of their plans to weaken the hold on the zaibatsu, or the drastic anti-corruption measures needed to lessen the hold Baron Kishi and the Prime Minister held over the Imperial Army. In a moment that could have destroyed any potential cooperation, Masanosuke insulted Kido's sweeping reformist policy, claiming he wanted nothing more than Kishi; an end of the old Japan, and a new, unstable system centered around himself. It was only a well-timed suggestion of a recess by an aide of Ikeda's that had stopped the coalition from collapse.\n\nReturning to the room once again, the discussion was less explosive, but none of three men looked at the other with anything but suspicion, worry, or boredom. Through the night they began to propose answers, an actual strategy to confront the Prime Minister and create a true opposition to his government. As each departed from the government complex in their chauffeured cars, they were unsure how far they could trust their new allies, but the three men could at least put on a show of defiance to Kaya and Kishi."

Close to three dozen other Imperial ships could be made out, closer or further from the lush tropical shores. Planes soared overhead in formation, performing evasive maneuvers as part of their drill, before dropping a number of blood-red flares onto the island. That was their cue.\n\nHe rushed over to the 25 millimeter anti-air guns, stumbling as the gun turrets fired off their shells, deafening him with each heavy thud. From the island, a number of balloons were let loose; target practice for the ship crews.\n\nBehind the gun's armor plates, his crewmate fed in new boxes of ammunition, while a spotter called out where to rotate the platform. The trail of bullets flew across the horizon, and the targets were all but neutralized in a matter of minutes. Catching his breath from the recoil, he saw landing craft move onto the beaches, the individual soldiers becoming little more than black specks as they sped on towards their target. Again the deck guns fired, and a pillar of sand and wooden debris spit out from the pristine coastline for a second. The landing ships unloaded as another set of balloons were sent drifting for the ships to target.\n\nThe wargame would continue for another day, as the combined forces of the Imperial Army and Navy were able to stage a successful operation on an enemy-occupied island. While the reports showed the anti-air gunners in the fleet did their job well, there was disappointment among high command about the speed of the Army, or so was the talk onboard. The sailors, proud men they were, onboard one of Japan's great ships, wouldn't dare admit any shortcomings; nor would the officers.\n\nTokyo deemed the results satisfactory enough, as Prime Minister Kaya approved a number of bills to increase expenses for such exercises, and their wargame would now be a biennial drill involving all members of the Co-Prosperity Sphere to instruct and test the newest doctrines thought up in the military academies."

They were content to sit and idle as the winds turned into a storm. They still fawned over Meiji nearly a century later, thankful his reforms did not remove them of their privileged status.\n\nHe spoke to the hundreds before him for his case, to support the current administration against the liberals like Takagi and the entrenched conservative wings of the Yokusankai, though he was careful to not name anyone in particular. Yes these were to be changes, but changes that would launch Japan into the great nation that it was destined to be; the future that millions had fought and worked for, could only be achieved through his careful maneuvering.\n\nAnd the Kokutai, oh how the old men loved to hear of it! Kaya emphasized throughout his speech of its importance, that the national identity, no, the national body of Japan would not be warped like the ideologies of the Americans and Germans. The Prime Minister will keep the essence of both the state and Emperor alive through his work, and their own co-operation. He was met with the traditional applause the nobility would give, slow and restrained, but he could sense they were now on his side. And the Kokutai, to him and anyone of importance, was now saved."

Or the mass arrests the Americans did, ever-paranoid about foreign enemies. The Prime Minister pushed these thoughts out of his head as he turned through the classified folders.\n\nFrom every branch of Japanese politics, somebody in Kaya's cabinet was upset at a liberal opponent. Their names reaches from city mayors to career officers, and everyone in between. Such a vast number of enemies was to be expected, Kaya thought to himself. His victory was won on a knife's edge, and had been teetering ever since. To boot out so many prominent figures so quickly would be of extraordinary risk. He turned to his own, personal list of opponents to clean out the Yokusankai. It was far smaller than the novels of enemies brought before him by his staff, a single admiral.\n\nTakagi Soukichi.\n\nContent, he handed the dossier back to an aide outside his office. The task would be great, and it could incur the wrath of every other faction in the Diet, even the Privy Council and Emperor himself.

Spurned on by Kaya's militant IJA, the representative was one of the lucky few Takagi was able to protect with his old connections in the Imperial Navy. A career admiral had taken him under his wing until this nightmare was over- he would be the one to stand up to Kaya's goons.\n\nTakagi's messages suggested that they would only need to be under IJN protection for a few days, until the Prime Minister realized not every target on his hit list would be so easy to arrest. And confronting the old guard of the admiralty, Takagi's close allies, would be a risky, if not outright foolish decision.

An insider of Kaya's navy chief had managed to procure parts of the coalition's latest set of enemies, though whether the Prime Minister intended to act on it remains unclear.\n\nAfter reading through the files, Takagi is the first to propose a publicly united opposition group to Kaya's consolidation of power around himself and his army friends. The other two men dismissed themselves soon after, making no promises to the admiral.\n\nBut they followed through. The conservatives were quick to join the suggested front, as Ikeda gave them a rousing speech that Kaya was to destabilize the prosperity bought through the sacrifices of the Great East Asian War. Kido met in secret with his own band in the Yokusankai, reminding them that the Reform Bureaucrats had managed to clean out a noticeable portion of the Liberals in the House of Representatives. Were they to sit back, there would be no doubt any message of the Emperor would get through to the Japanese government. Neither Ikeda nor Kido considered this united opposition more important than protecting their friends from suspicious policemen sent from Kaya himself, but the danger was imminent. Kaya's victory would be stopped, or marred in scandal and infamy by their efforts."

And now he had proved himself enough to deliver one of Kaya's new proposals to be voted on. He had managed to guarantee the Conservative's support, and Ikeda's clique would always be enough to pass any bill!\n\nHe sat in his office when the call came. Could it be congratulations from the other Reform Bureaucrats? An offer to Kaya's cabinet? He quickly ordered the call put through to him, but the voice was not bearing good news.\n\n"Unfortunately, Ikeda has found that your newest proposal is unsatisfactory. I'm afraid I will be signing off of this policy, nor will I vote for it. It is all too clear to any Representative that such powers should not be granted to the Prime Minister. That is all, Representative Noguchi."\n\nHe barely had time to stammer a response, a plea, a threat, anything, before his co-sponsor ended the conversation.

Kido himself had foes in the Imperial Army, the Navy, and his previous government as Prime Minister was a madhouse to say little more. The only places a man like him could hide were among the ranks of aloof and old-fashioned aristocrats among the Emperor's council. Kaya expected some whimpering from the barons and princes, but Kido had managed to make them a proactive force! With disapproval from the House of Peers and most certainly some form of condemnation from the Privy Council, his next list of arrests had met a dangerous obstacle.\n\nHe had promised them all they wanted; their meddlesome worries about the Kokutai were soothed, and promised them enough vague benefits, but the blue bloods would always stick to themselves, even if it meant the downfall of everything they clutched so dear.

I personally suspect that the issue may lie with Satou-san's allies and relatives in Kaya's administration, who would likely not wish to see their kin labelled as a suspected traitor to the Empire.\n\nOne investigator has begun to question whether Representative Kishi, a relative of Satou and a close friend to the Prime Minister, is the power behind this action. Their questioning borders on accusations of Kishi-san himself being a traitor, but such officers will quickly be reprimanded for their actions if they attempt to pursue this theory any further."

"I presume that this is in the utmost interest of our goals, Kaya-san?" They were an odd pair: the Prince with his immaculate manners and spotless looks, the Prime Minister with bedraggled eyes and graying, bloated cheeks.\n\n"This is absolutely excellent, my Prince." Kaya's hands seized the nearest envelope, fingers digging in like teeth biting into flesh. "May I open them?"\n\n"Of course, Kaya-san."\n\nA crack, as he disarmed the letters from the Emperor's protection. Sheets of paper, neatly-typed lines. Lists that seemed to go on forever and ever, correlating the specific nobles with their individual sins. Some border on the ludicrous, but all were as plausible as the authority of the author: the Prince himself. "These are all marvelous, Prince Takeda." Kaya leaned back, pleased. "Very marvelous. Now, all I need is a telephone, and our government will be secure."\n\nThe Prince gave a slight chuckle. "Doing the Devil proud, aren't we?""

Raindrops rapped the windows, a cadence in harmony to the tip-tapping of the rooftops. The dances of the ceilings and chandeliers amid the drizzle met the muffled huff of politicians preparing for the promulgation of a new law.\n\n"You know, Kaya." Kishi said, standing by his protege near a window, observing the rain as it sprayed the fields of the Diet building in waves upon waves carried by the fierce wind. "'Law for the Restoration of the Economy' is a good name. Good enough for what I - we - have in store." He watched as a pedestrian bounded to the nearest cover, her heels digging into the rain-drenched streets, up, down, up, down, dispersing water in her wake. "It is impossible to please everyone. You know this as well as I do."\n\n"The Yokusankai does not like the idea." Kaya said, tapping the windowsill. "The nobility is displeased. I don't know, Kishi-san. It seems that we are making enemies of the entire nation."\n\n"Then let them come. Or are you a coward like all the others, Kaya?"\n\n"O-of course not.""

A shrill quiet draped itself over the sounds and noises of the courtyards, the trees rustling as if in nervous unease.\n\nYet within one of the building's many forgotten corners, the work of government had not yet ceased. With a lone electric light illuminating their work, its footmen set out to type names - traitors, corrupt politicians under the zaibatsus' and keiretsus' payroll. The typewriters' melodic cackles seemed in synchrony with the bootheels clacking against the lacquered wooden floor-boards. Hushed voices spoke as if shamed by surreptitiousness.\n\nAbove it all, Prime Minister Okinori Kaya observed the cabinet's comings and goings, nothing escaping his stare. Kishi might be his master, but Kaya was also a bureaucrat. He was in his element amid the lines of paper and blackmail blurring into one cohesive whole: a graven image of all the traitors to the nation, those who sold the divine Kokutai to the machinations of lowly profiteers.\n\nWhen dawn finally arrived, the Prime Minister ordered his clerks to clear out. Tomorrow was the day of cleansing. Japan shall burn, its structures reduced to cinders - and only those left standing shall be worthy of the new order that Kaya and Kishi had envisioned. It starts of course, with a name."

Any and all that you say can and will be used against you within the court of law." If it were any other sunny day in Tokyo, Masaharu would have gone to work - instead, the police knocked on his doors, carrying him away dressed in his pajamas. It was a humiliation, and the neighbors looked with second-hand embarrassment.\n\nThe officer threw him into the paddy wagon, and none too gently. His knees rang against the metal bed. Masaharu rose to explain, but the back slammed itself shut before his eyes. He sighed, and his eyes adjusted to the darkness. If the officer would not listen to his protestations, perhaps he could share his woe with his fellow prisoners-to-be. Men, old and young, in various states of dress, trembled, afraid to even speak. Masaharu recognized a few faces. They mostly belonged in the corporate lobby of the Yokusankai: liberals, conservatives, and even a Kidoite sitting close to the wagon's cabin, furthest from Masaharu.\n\nA morbid joke sprang itself unto his mind. 'What are you in for?' Masaharu did not know, but perhaps these men would know. He tried to get their attention, to pull them away even slightly from the world of chaos and fear. Yet, no one answered. It seemed that guilt was universal among the inhabitants of the paddy wagon. Masaharu scratched his head and waited until the station came into view. He was the last arrest of the day."

Masaharu sat in one, the walls to his side perforated by holes from which the police could record his conversation. Regardless, a recording machine, with tapes tuned to every signal of the microphone, stood atop the lone table, regarding the aging Diet deputy with its eyes: twin spools containing its reels.\n\nMasaharu answered every question truthfully. They first made him swear an oath to the state and emperor, which he found to be bombastic but he conceded. Now, did he receive money from Zaibatsus or Keiretsus? No, they could check his account transfer history. Did he propagate subversive attacks against the state? No, Masaharu was not a socialist, much less an anarchist. Did he have any inklings as to why he was there? Nope, and he hopes that he could obtain legal counsel - the way the Tokyo PD had handled his case seemed on the edge of brusque and abusive.\n\nDid he have names? No. On and on the last question came, like waves trying to erode a rock. Names. Names. Names. No. No. No. At the end of it, however, Masaharu caved. If they wanted the names of the corporate stooges, here they go. Just one thing - leniency. At this, the police sergeant gave him a smirk. Lenience, he should have. They brought a typewriter into the room and churned out lines after lines of "corrupt" officials for the Kaya administration to arrest. After that, they returned him to his cell, the sergeant thanking him for his cooperation."

He glimpsed at it: its rays penetrated the window-bars of his prison, and sometimes he would raise himself unto his bed, trying to feel. The food was terrible. The rice was crumbly and hard, and Masaharu's brittle teeth could not bite into them. When exercise time came, Masaharu could barely keep up with the younger inmates, who made fun of him. "What are you in for?" echoed in the halls whenever Masaharu came near. He had refused to tell anyone the actual cause of his imprisonment because he himself did not know why.\n\nThe police brought inmates in today. The skies were heavily overcast, and the new fish - not Masaharu's preferred terminology - marched forward, eyes downwards. Masaharu saw his fellow convicts jeer and shout at the arrivals, criticizing everything, from their clothing and possessions. It must have been cathartic for them, Masaharu thought. Three days in any prison acquaints a man's minds to hate people who bring aspects of the "outside world" which meant glimpses of freedom. At times, it signaled a world that was changing, and no one here was any part of it.\n\nWhen they returned Masaharu to his cell, he saw a young man occupy the bottom bunk. Masaharu knew him. He was in one of the lists that he gave. It seemed that the keepers of this place had a penchant for poetic justice. Trembling, Masaharu tried to strike up a conversation. The young man paused and then moved his lips to answer."

The joke elicited a smirk from Takagi. "Well, I am not happy with the current state of things, and I bet the navy establishment wouldn't, either."\n\nTakagi sat up. "You are the navy establishment, Tomioka."\n\n"Interesting remark, Takagi-san. Well, the Navy would like a change of air. A different person in charge, you see. No one is happy with the current status quo. Politicians getting arrested and all that: it feels suitably like the 40s again." Tomioka looked down. "Those were troubling times. Yet, neither we nor the Army can nominate a Prime Minister - look at what happened to Hideki Tojo's Ministry." He seemed to shudder. "Not that again. The Yokusankai is preferable to what happened then. Luckily," he regarded Takagi with a sharp eye. "I have just the right man for the job."\n\n"Still, how do you plan on taking out the government? With the fat checks they are paying the Army with, as well as blackmail material, political arrests - it seems that the odds are against us."\n\n"The Meiji Constitution. Topple the government with the resignation of the Army and Navy Ministers. Kaya will wake up one day and find the resignation letters on his desk. Then you will make your move.

When they finally stopped dragging their feet and came into the negotiation table, it was in a cheap restaurant at one of the darker street-corners of Tokyo. Through the dusty, dirty windows, Takagi could see the sun's reddening rays as it approached the horizon, ready to set. His meeting was with a young army major, one of the commanders of Yokohama's local protection force.\n\n"Major," Takagi called out as he saw the figure of a man he had been looking for. "Nice to see you." He extended out his hand, only to be met with a cold, cynical gaze. When the major did return this gesture, it was with lethargy and languor. They sat down and ordered food. In the meantime, Takagi examined the Major. Army uniform, not much older than 32. Must be an overachiever or something.\n\nThe major broke the silence. "It is unusual for the sea winds to blow landwards in this time of chaos," he said, eyeing Takagi. "Although the Army cannot say that it is pleased with the current status-quo. The Prime Minister," he mumbled looking over his shoulders as he did so. "pleases the Army with maneuvers and the like. However, his true intent is clear: the control of the armed forces is subsumed under his control. Takagi-san." He said, looking at the admiral straight in the eye. "The Army chooses to support your bid. I am here to discuss the specifics."\n\nTheir meal arrived in plates steaming with aroma."

In a cafe within the gentrified districts of Tokyo, the Admiral meets the Marquess. A low light hung above, ensconced within a chandelier. The warm and bawdy smell of coffee drifted from table to table. Nobles sat down and departed, almost without notice. Everything was quiet, except for the whisperings of a few patrons.\n\n"What do you think happened?" Kido said, his eyebrows arched. "Several nobles are on the run. Some swore off politics, and the Emperor seemingly did not care for the fate of his kin. This is a disaster." Taking a perfumed handkerchief from his coat pockets, Kido wiped the sweat that lathered his face. "I suppose, there is still one avenue to solve this problem." Kido laid his eyes on Takagi as if sizing him for the first time. "I suppose you would do. I dislike liberal politics, but I can support your candidacy."\n\n"How did y-"\n\n"I have eyes and ears everywhere, Admiral. I know that you've had contacts and dealings with the Army and the Navy. I suppose," Kido sighed. "I have no other choice."\n\n"I suppose no one has the luxury these days."\n\nThe next words were extraordinary; Takagi had never heard Kido swear before."

They met in a cheap udon stand, by the side of the road.\n\nIt was not a good place for Takagi to be in: it was too close to the Diet building. "Kishi and his pawn don't go here," Satou said, as they walked closer to the street-stand. "Too cheap for their blood." He gave a chuckle, but neither Ikeda nor Takagi laughed. Still, warm food made Takagi's eyes water.\n\n"Yes," Takagi said. "What the Prime Minister doesn't realize is that this is not his game." He hushed his voice. "The Army and the Navy are ready to make their move. They will pull their ministers in a few weeks, and that will be our opportunity to spring our trap."\n\n"Our?" Ikeda said. "Takagi-san, I apologize, but you're assuming things a bit too far. I suggest taking it back slightly." Then he became quiet. "Although I suppose I would not be opposed to your candidacy. I don't have any power within the Diet, not anymore. Kishi's pawn tears the conservatives to bits, turning good politicians into corrupt bureaucrats."\n\n"We'll see, Ikeda-san.""

A meeting with Kishi did not serve to make his morning better. The devil of Manchukuo was not a pleasant man. Praise, abuse, cajole, force, pick up by the scruff of the neck, only to be dropped unceremoniously to the floor.\n\nWhen he reached his office, his groggy eyes centered their gaze to the two letters on his desk. No aide came to deliver it - it was just there. On their envelopes were written: Kaigun and Rikugun. The Navy and the Army were not the types to send letters. Today was most unusual. Unless the letters wer-\n\nHe lurched forward, a realization foisted on his sleep-addled mind, a waking force far stronger than a pinch. His hands reached for the letters and tore their seals apart. He paused to read every line. "Resignation. We of the Navy hereby request our dismissal..." No. No! He had gotten so far. He could not fail here. "Resignation. We of the Army hereby request our dismissal..."\n\nKaya let the letters drift off his hand. After a moment, his fists pounded the table, and he shouted, far louder than he had in his whole life."

Betrayal! Betrayal! Kaya swore that he would shoot the lot of them given the chance.\n\nHe tried Kido's number. A few redirections later, he was speaking to the President of the Privy Council.

The conservatives, liberals, and Kidoites formed a new frontbench, with the defeated reform bureaucrats sat in the back, much shrunken. Kaya was nowhere to be seen, having requested a break from the proceedings.\n\n"I promise this chamber," Takagi said, standing straight, "and the people of Japan, that the new government shall not follow the abuses of the old. We, the new government of the Yokusankai, shall strive to reform Japanese society, and contain the excesses of the previous administration." He took a deep breath. "I would like to thank my seniors within the Taisei Yokusankai, two deputies of exceptional virtue: Masanosuke Ikeda and Kouichi Kido.

The balding, greyish hairline that belonged to the visage of Kouichi Kido reared its head around here, of course.\n\n"I beg your pardon," Ikeda said, baffled. "Marquess. I thought that the Diet building is accessible to all - whether Peer or Deputy." Ikeda would not have even gone near the lounge if not for the dire political circumstances. The maroon-tinted cushions did not sit well with him, and nor did the golden-framed chairs and sofas. His tea, steaming with faint vapors and encased within a dainty little cup, bore his eyes against himself as if to ask, 'why are you here?'\n\nKido knew why, even if Ikeda didn't. "Of course.

Son of a veteran of the Sino-Japanese war, born right when the sakura blossoms fluttered their way through the fervid spring weather: Takeda had never known the hardship of war.\n\n"How did the meeting go, Ikeda-sama?"

His words made no impression on Ikeda's mind; it should have been the conservatives who rule the chamber, and thus the state. At this juncture, however, what can you do, he thought. Takagi promised reform: firstly, an end to the politicized violence, and secondly, the release of political prisoners arrested on wrongful charges made by the previous government.\n\n"I would like to thank my fellow Deputies," Takagi's sudden words met Ikeda's mind with a searching, dull echo, "Kouichi Kido-san and Masanosuke Ikeda-san. Without their help, I would not have reached the same resolve to form a government to replace what was lost." It was a nice gesture, but it did not dissolve the feeling of disappointment in Ikeda's heart, which lay in its whole, enormous shape, like a giant hunk of salt.\n\nThen they voted. The conservatives, Kidoites, and liberals voted as one, a majority. The old government had gone out; another was coming in, like ships leaving and entering ports."

 japkaya.100.d:0 ""Welcome to your new office, Prime Minister Kaya. Hope it serves you well." said the secretary before quickly walking away. The room itself was nothing luxurious. It was medium-sized, modest, and plain, just the way he liked it. As Kaya sat down on the black velvet chair, he began to think. His mind drifted off, imagining Japan under his tenure, recovered and reinvigorated. "Prime Minister, we have some matters to discuss." a voice boomed, throwing Kaya back into reality. For now, he noted, such thoughts remained wistful thinking.\n\n"Regarding the status of your cabinet" mentioned one advisor, "We have mostly filled out their positions with dignitary individuals. Feel free to look at their portfolios here and please do bring up any concerns. We will try our best to resolve them." "Thank you, I will attend to these shortly." said Kaya "However, our biggest concern as of late is our support base. I'm sure you're all aware of our popularity during the election campaigns." All heads nodded in agreement. "We are but one of the many camps within the Yokusankai, and there were some candidates who had larger support from within the government and the people, yet we won despite all that." Kaya continued, "While we have made it this far, we cannot continue further unless we find external support in order to ensure we still remain on top in the following months."\n\n"...with that, our meeting has been completed. Thank you all for your time, and you are now dismissed." stated Kaya, closing the hour-long session. As the advisors shuffled out of the room, Kaya stared back down again at his notes. There was an outline for three potential choices he could make. He could use his contacts with the hardline Reform Bureaucrats, or he could approach his opposition, Ikeda and Kido, or by good examples and fulfilled promises, he could earn the support of the Diet and the people. Kaya slumped back on his chair, thinking of his next move."

However, favors like these come at a price, and we hope you'll be able to pay it upfront." said Satou with a hint of menace in his tone.\n\nKaya stiffened up, then responded back. "Satou-sama," said Kaya "no burden is too much to bear if one wishes to achieve success. However, I cannot accept your offer unless what I receive is equal in value. Allow me to speak directly to your leader so we may negotiate on equal terms." Kaya reached for his phone then rotated its dial, and soon waited for the line to pick up.\n\n"...consider it done. However, would you like me to send other things as well? I'm sure additional manpower would be of great use to you." said the voice on the other end with a light chuckle.\n\n"No, thank you. Our positions are fully manned." said Kaya "However, don't forget to guarantee us some help in gaining some support, while we will uphold our end and grant Teiichi Suzuki a seat in the Diet and position of Economic Minister."\n\nThe voice chuckled once more, "Easier said than done, see you soon my friend."

"The economic crisis brought by the collapse of Yasuda was catastrophic, its aftershock still felt to this day." said Suzuki, pointing to graphs with statistics of various industries affected by the collapse. "However, I have devised a solution, which shall see rapid regrowth and ensures Japan reaches her pre-crisis levels, or..." he paused dramatically, "even possibly higher." Small murmurs began, then a hand slowly rose from the audience. It was Takami Eto, a member from the House of Representatives.\n\n"Excuse me, Suzuki-san, but I object to these proposals of yours. It is all simply too much." Eto stated. "As your fellow peer, I suggest these plans be toned down a bit. If it won't make it through here, how much better will it fare with everyone else?" Several people in the room nodded in agreement. Suzuki firmly shook his head and replied sternly.\n\n"No." he stated "I offered myself to alleviate this crisis as quickly as possible, and this is how I'm treated?" said Suzuki enraged, angrily striking his pointing stick at the board. "I will see the start and end of this, and I will not be stopped by anyone, be it the public or the politicians!"\n\nA long silence, followed by loud grumbling. Suzuki glanced at Eto, loudly fuming in his place. Despite the rabblet, Prime Minister Kaya remained silent, showing no apparent signs of disdain or disappointment. Suzuki now wondered if Kaya would still help him achieve his goals, or would he retract his support and leave him in the dust, prey to his fellow cabinet members. He would have to find out soon."

His beady eyes shifted to Kaya, awaiting a response.\n\n"Good sir, no need for confrontation. Do you realize these plans are essential? Don't you see the benefits they bring?" said Kaya. A stony stare indicated uninterest. Kaya sighed, and spoke again. "Forget your views, think logically. Ponder the good it will do to you, I, and the countless people. Economy, prestige, and everything in between will return, a thousand times fold."\n\n"Do you honestly expect me to believe such deceit? Even with your position as Prime Minister, I can't tolerate such decadence. I demand you revise these plans, immediately." said the portly man, slamming his hand onto the table.\n\n"I realize this entire meeting is pointless. Why do I seek a pillar to lean on, instead of creating my own? My proposals, once implemented, will garner me enough support, meaning I won't need the help from you or your accomplices. Go file complaints all you want, I don't care. None of it changes the fact I have the final say. You are dismissed, thank you for your time."\n\nThe bald official stood in confusion and reacted only seconds later. He bared his teeth and cried out in frustration. "The Emperor shall know and you'll be detained! You're not safe, Okinori!" spoke the fat man, jabbing a finger into Kaya's chest. He stomped out, slamming the door behind him in anger. Kaya merely rolled his eyes."

 japkaya.109.d:0 "With the announcement of his appointment as Prime Minister, Kaya had scouted the vast landscape of the Taisei Yokusankai in hopes of gathering potential alliances to cement himself in these unstable circumstances. Kaya searched left and right, deeming individuals who could be helpful in his mission to gain support not only from the politicians in the backrooms of the Imperial Diet, but the general populace in all of Japan as well.\n\nNews sources arriving from the Diet Building itself indicates that Kaya was willing to accept people, regardless of background, who devote their efforts to his government and pledge their support for him, with their compensation of "certain" influence within the proposals placed forward. With this turnout, many within the party have stated their distaste and are skeptical of this policy, as it could potentially attract radical or undesirables lurking within the framework of the bureaucracy which could destabilize the cabinet and cripple its effectiveness. Despite this, Kaya previously stated that this is necessary to improve the government and rectify the previous government's misdoings.\n\nAs the news broadcast played in the background, Kaya and his close associates confided and began to whisper in hushed tones. The many voices muddled together and spoke in unison "Are you sure this is the right decision? What would happen if this fails? You'd be in hot water if your plan goes awry. Please, reconsider, for the sake of the party." After a period of silence, Kaya began to speak.\n\n"Gentlemen, I can assume you, the situation is under control. This will not jeopardize any of us. Let us think rationally. We are merely a small cub in the lion's den. We will not survive a day alone."

This, however, wasn't the short barrage typical of the officials, but a single powerful knock enough for him to get the message. "Come in, I've been expecting you," said Kaya. He gestured for his guest to take a seat. "It's been some time since we last talked in person, hasn't it?" Kaya continued. "Please make yourself comfortable, Ikeda-san."\n\nIkeda began to speak. "It has been a while indeed. However, I'd like to drop formalities for a moment. I have a concern, particulary with your plans for the future." Ikeda took a few seconds to think before he spoke. "I must ask you to cut down on your militaristic outlook. It's all too much. We live in a time of peace, and surely there is no need for such aggresive talk, is there? We must focus on rebuilding the economy first and foremost," he stated. Ikeda coughed, then went on. "In return, I'll extend my support to you. I have many friends in many circles, and they can drum up some support for you if you help in kind. You can be assured of that much." Ikeda smiled.\n\nBut he was not yet finished. "There is another matter. You must also preserve some men in high positions, colleages of mine who I have faith in. Don't worry - they shall not contest your position. However, I will need them there in light of the conservatives' position in the Diet."\n\nKaya raised an eyebrow. Two tall orders had been asked of him, and realistically he couldn't agree to both. He would have to disappoint Ikeda by choosing one concession over the other. The question was, which one?"

Make yourself comfortable," said Kaya through gritted teeth.\n\n"Kaya, calm down. I'm not here to play around," sneered Kido. "Come, let us discuss the future of Japan."\n\n"Did you even schedule an appointment? I heard you merely showed up, walked past my secretary and headed straight for my office," said Kaya, staring dispassionately.\n\nKido shrugged in response. "The details don't matter. What matters is our discussion," said Kido. "You've mentioned the need for support. Well, I offer my hand to you. I will ensure your ministry doesn't fall apart," Kido smiled. "Of course, I expect something in return." His voice dropped, any semblance of emotion gone. "As you know, I am a member of the House of Peers, and a very powerful individual. I could make a good ally," said Kido. "Being friends will benefit both of us. But this can only happen if you sideline Kishi. He is, frankly, a very radical thinker. He's not someone I want to work with. If you do push him away, I'm more than willing to work closely with you. If you don't accept, I'm afraid you're on your own." Having concluded his offer, Kido's bubbly facade returned. It was positively unnerving.\n\nKaya was distraught by the offer. He knew Kido was a close associate of the Emperor, and wielded power in the House of Peers because of it. Having someone like that could be beneficial as insurance in case his support dwindled. On the other hand, Kido was no friend to him, and Kishi was. Would he drag Kishi through the mud just to save himself?\n\nAs Kaya made up his mind he looked at Kido sternly, as the other drummed his hands on the table impatiently, waiting for a response. "Listen here, Kido. I've decided that..."

We can help ensure your term does not come to an end soon, but you'll have to do something for us..."\n\n"What do you want?" returned Kaya.\n\n"Consider this a gift, which will help you to stabilize your position for a bit longer." The man gazed at Kaya intensely. "We've drawn up a few proposals. Make your choice, Prime Minister."\n\nSilently, Kaya looked over his potential options on his sheets of paper and decided. Each option offered stung; his pride and status were under attack by some short buffoon. Despite the posturing however, Kaya suppressed his anger as he read over the paper. Internally, he allowed a brief fantasy of violence against the ringleader of the Kouktai. Kaya would make sure that man would pay, all in due time.\n\n"What will it be this time, Mr. Prime Minister?" said the bald man snidely, as his accomplices leered."

Kaya's forehead wrinkled in frustration as he continued to read the legislative documents. He realized most reforms and policies passed had been rendered useless by the course of time. Despite this, the Prime Minister before him hadn't even bothered to change them. "But why? Why haven't they been changed? Why have they been left to rot on these pieces of paper?" Kaya thought as he shuffled through the paperwork.\n\nHis train of thought was interrupted as his secretary entered the room with a cup of tea. "Thank you," said Kaya. The secretary nodded silently and left the office, leaving Kaya to his throughts once more. Kaya drank the tea quickly, then returned to the seemingly unending work of editing and revising policies rendered useless by the passage of time, to be replaced by new ones more beneficial to the interests of Japan and, by extension, the Sphere.\n\nSeveral hours later, Kaya allowed himself a small sigh of satisfaction. He had drawn an outline for the revision of several policies, and several new ones he would announce in time. With this, he hoped that the mistakes of before would not be repeated through him. His work complete, Kaya rose from his chair and strode out of the office to return home."

 japkaya.115.t:0 "The Longest Night"
 japkaya.115.d:0 "Kaya had been struggling to make a list for several hours. He didn't want to do the deed. It was just a simple list of names, yet, for some reason, Kaya felt something stir in him as he wrote.\n\nSome of them Kaya had known for years. Many were dear friends, as well as his co-partners, who spent long strenuous hours of time working with him. Whether they bickered or gotten angry at each other once or twice, but Kaya knew they always held each other in high regard. Kaya remembered his days as a fledgling official, stumbling his way around the system, despite that, many showed him the correct path, the path to success. Without those people, Kaya thought, he wouldn't be the person he was now. He wouldn't be the leader, the man in charge of all of Japan.\n\nKaya's writing slowed down, his hand growing numb. He felt conflicted and saddened. Who to remove and who to keep? His body kept on writing but his brain was telling him to stop. He was wrestling with self-consciousness at this point. "Stop writing, scrap that list, and just keep them, they are your closest and only friends. If you replace the people you trust, you won't be safe anymore. Not there." His consciousness was correct, yet, he soldiered on and continued to write.\n\nThen Kaya realized that his memories of the past were clouding his mind and hampering his judgement. He realized that he was dwelling on the past, and not looking towards the future. In his mind, it clicked, and his writing quickened and paced, his fervor high. His goal was grand in scale, grand enough to overcome any bonds he'd made. His passion surged, as powerful as the tidal Great Wave. His determination grew higher than Mt. Fuji itself. What Kaya would remember that day, was that his purpose, to let the Rising Sun rise higher than it ever did, would be his number one priority, and that he'd let nothing prevent him from completing his quest.\n\nSeveral hours later, at dawn, Kaya had managed to finish writing the list. It was long and unorganized. While preparing to get ready for work, Kaya took one last look at the paper and as he stuffed it in the suitcase, Kaya shed one single tear and whispered softly:"

Turning on the television, Kaya was pleasantly surprised when he heard them holding a discussion, in great detail, about the new bill he had recently drafted.\n\n"After conferring with many businesses and engineers, Kaya has decided to draft a bill allowing for the allocation of several million yens worth of investment into various material companies in an effort to increase overall extraction of resources." said the newscaster. "This new project reached the ears of people like investors and engineers. Many held unanimous agreements in favor of it and many around the Sphere overjoyed as this new plan would lead to many more opportunities for not only the shareholders above, but perhaps even the workers below as well."\n\nUpon hearing this, Kaya's mouth curved upwards into that of a smirk. The final icing on the cake to this chain of events was Kaya discovered a single bottle of sake in his office pantry, which he felt would be a shame to not use. With these things in place, Kaya leaned back on his chair with satisfaction and drank his sake triumphantly as the headlines rolled on and on."

He sniffled and brushed his nose, insisting he was fine. The first soldier chuckled, and expressed his cynicism at his service in the IJA; he believed he was fooled into serving his country, and instead is serving the interests of the political class in the Diet. The sniffling soldier looked up to his rambling comrade with tired eyes and grinned in agreement, but remained silent and overcome with futility.

Kishi has little interest in directly seizing power from Kaya - as much as he could easily do so, it would require too many contingencies and formalities.

 japkaya.1002.desc:0 "Kishi Nobusuke is alone in his office in the wee hours of the morning. Laid in front of him was a bottle of cognac, a pack of Gauloises and newspapers. Of note was a folder marked with the seal of the Judiciary - a folder containing the profiles of promising judges and judiciary bureaucrats. They were supposed to head directly to the Prime Minister, but upon the veiled threats of career suicide and exile through Kishi's goons, they ended up at his desk. Nothing personal, Kishi thought to himself - it's just business after all, before picking up one of the newspapers.\n\n"Justice Rules In Favour Of Student Leader in Peace Preservation Law Controversy".\n\nKishi lets out a little tut-tut before taking another sip from the glass of cognac. In his eyes, this was merely another failure of the justice system to uphold Kokutai. If they couldn't uphold the very fabric of the Japanese state, how would they even be reliable appendages for any further reforms to the Japanese state? Cutting his train of thought, he pulled out another folder of his own - a list of reliable, or pliable bureaucrats and judiciary officials from his days in Manchuria, and began to sort them out.\n\nNAKANO, FUMIO: ATTORNEY-GENERAL, SHINKYOU SPECIAL MUNICIPALITY (1947-1954)FUMIAKI, AKIRA: DEPUTY JUSTICE, SPECIAL SECURITY COURT (1956 - 1959)Kishi did not stop filing until the sun rose. The last thing he did before he went home in the morning was leaving the dossier on Kaya's office doorstep."

 japkaya.1003.desc:0 ""Kishi and Kaya sat together in the Kentai, reading newspapers and sipping from the finest teas prepared for the Prime Minister. After reading a column dedicated to the recent political unrest in the nation, Kishi folded his newspaper and turned to the Prime Minister, grinning with a cruel smile, and began to speak.\n\n"Mr. Prime Minister, have you seen what those bastards think they can get away with these days? They don't have respect for us anymore; even some of the MPs talk down upon the empire. I think it's best if we taught them a lesson - we must show them that we are here to stay."\n\nKaya looked at Kishi with eyes rounded with awe. He knew his colleague was right; dissenters were far too comfortable in criticising the government, and they needed to know their place. What his sinister tone, however, indicated he was willing to go a step too far.\n\n"Kishi, you give a fair point, but we're not tyrants." the Prime Minister chuckled, glancing up at Kishi who was now staring him down with feverish, bloodshot eyes. Kaya took a deep breath and returned to his newspaper, hiding from the striking gaze of the wicked man.""

Kaya, who sat behind his desk, refused to cower in the face of such intimidation. Kishi spoke slowly, uttering each word with an intent to make his position clear to the Prime Minister.\n\n"Prime Minister... you and I both know the importance of funding the military appropriately. The army's budget has... constrained much of their operations and capability to defend the Sphere. We all ask you to... alleviate this issue. Now, will you be the man to pride the empire's military for its role in safeguarding the Pacific... or will you be the one sapping away it's ability to defend the women and children of this great nation?"\n\n"Mr. Kishi, we've played this game before - I will not be intimidated by you! Besides, we've already spent a long while calculating the perfect budget; the army doesn't need anything more. Throwing more at it will overburden the coffers-"\n\n"Mr. Prime Minister, I don't think you... understand. I could very well ask your colleagues who preside over the budget to resign. I am not asking if you can do it; I am asking if YOU want to do it."\n\nKishi's malevolent presence loomed over Kaya, irking the Prime Minister with a profound shock. He was under immense strain and now was visibly sweating, giving in to the intense pressures of the powerful and coercive politician.""

 JAP_kaya_influence_fight_desc:0 "The Reform Bureaucrats are an unorthodox clique: some were ex-socialists, others were ultranationalists, and there are even ex-military men within the clique. By the 1960s however, they had broadly solidified themselves into two cliques: Kaya Okinori's moderates, and Kishi Nobusuke's hardliners.\n\nWith Kaya's ascension to power, the moderates have ingrained themselves into the post-war political mainstream. Given their lack of public charisma and appeal however, they have made themselves vulnerable to attacks from the hardliners, and only time can tell if the moderates are truly eclipsed by the radical ideologues.\n\nHardliner Influence: [?JAP.party_popularity@ultranational_socialism|%]\nRemaining YSK influence: [?JAP_kaya_total_ysk_influence|%]\n\nTotal Kayaite Influence on Diet: [?JAP_kaya_influence_total|%]\n§!Kayaite§!
