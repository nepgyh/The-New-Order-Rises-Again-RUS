###KAYA INITIAL TREE###
 JAP_kaya_time:0 "Prime Minister Kaya"
 JAP_kaya_time_desc:0 "With Kaya at the helm of Japan itself, one can expect much change under his administration. A former Reform Bureaucrat turned Prime Minister, Kaya harbors ambitions to deal with the various factors preventing Japan from reaching its maximum potential.\\n\\nFrom the conflict between the Zaibatsus and Keiretsus and the interservice rivalry between the Army and Navy, Kaya plans to end the discord, one way or another. His final plan is synthesizing the government, military, and industry into one cohesive unit after settling their individual disputes, all to redirect their efforts to serve Japan, first and foremost.\\n\\nWhether it requires stripping power from the various companies, mending the divide in both departments of the armed forces, or cleansing his cabinet of uncooperative members, Kaya will ensure that he and his Reform Bureaucrats get what they desire, no matter the cost."
 JAP_the_new_cabinet:0 "Новый кабинет"
 JAP_the_new_cabinet_desc:0 "Первая задача любого нового премьер-министра - сформировать новый кабинет. В него войдут как близкие политические соратники, так и талантливые кадры; будут проводиться еженедельные встречи для обсуждения текущей обстановки\n\nМы должны действовать быстро, чтобы закрепиться на японской политической сцене и заручиться поддержкой, ведь другие фракции АПТ смотрят на наше молодое правительство свысока с презрением в глазах. Если мы как-либо покажем слабость, они без колебаний уничтожат нас.\n\nНаш Император дал нам шанс, но они так не поступят. Мы докажем, что стервятники ошибаются."
 JAP_appeal_to_the_hardliners:0 "Обращение к сторонникам жёсткой линии"
 JAP_appeal_to_the_hardliners_desc:0 "Возможно, это трудный выбор, но есть несколько других приемлемых вариантов. Учитывая эти ограничения, решено, что поддержка технократов - "бюрократов-реформаторов" - это то, что необходимо для успеха.\n\nВозглавляемая Эцусабуро Сииной и Нобусукэ Киси, эта клика технократической фракции является сторонниками кейнсианской технократии, стиля управления, который привел Империю к известности, но с тех пор вышел из моды, поскольку Япония впала в застойный статус-кво.\n\nКая встретится с ними обоими  с целью заручиться их поддержкой своего кабинета и согласовать их роли с восстановлением этой кейнсианской технократии - и, возможно, с ней, с возрождением самой Японии."
 JAP_rub_our_back:0 "Потри нам спину"
 JAP_rub_our_back_desc:0 "Как и ожидалось, и Киси, и Сиина предложили нам свои условия в обмен на их поддержку. Они запросили назначения конкретных лиц во всем правительстве, все они либо входят в клику бюрократов-реформаторов, либо являются экономическими чиновниками, имеющими связи с экономическими центрами по всей сфере, - у всех из которых есть связи, как скрытые, так и очевидные для Киси.\n\nВ дополнение к этим назначениям, Киси были даны конкретные обещания по поддержке и укреплению Министерства торговли, особенно в отношении дел Маньчжурии, а также других рынков в Империи и более широкой Сферы совместного процветания.\n\nЦена за их поддержку высока, но если мы хотим добиться успеха, это будет та цена, которую нам придётся заплатить."
 JAP_and_we_will_rub_yours:0 "И мы потрем твою"
 JAP_and_we_will_rub_yours_desc:0 "И Киси, и Сиина хорошо понимают, что если мы собираемся оказать эти услуги бюрократам-реформаторам, то есть определённые ожидания. Нам потребуется их поддержка в отношении нескольких ключевых направлений политики.\n\nВ частности, реформирование Совета по планированию Кабинета министров.\n\nЧтобы правительство Каи преуспело, полномочия и обязанности Совета по планированию Кабинета министров должны быть реформированы и расширены для реализации его видения Японии. Сам по себе Кая знает, что эти усилия не увенчаются успехом. Однако при поддержке бюрократов-реформаторов, а также Министерства торговли его шансы намного выше.\n\nЭто будет проверкой Киси по влиянию в Китае, а также их готовности помочь нам."
 JAP_a_new_face:0 "Новое лицо"
 JAP_a_new_face_desc:0 "Поскольку кабинет министров продолжает заполняться, и Киси, и Сиина выдвинули неожиданного кандидата на должность министра иностранных дел - бывшего исполнительного директора провинции Гуандун и видного министра Большой Восточной Азии Тейити Судзуки.\n\nСудзуки ранее с позором ушел в отставку после кризиса Ясуда и последующего экономического краха в Гуандуне - все это было очень публичным делом. Хотя его неудача имела мало общего с внешней политикой, Кая не уверен, что он является подходящим выбором, особенно когда есть более безопасные варианты.\n\nОднако выбор кого-то другого рисковал бы вызвать недовольство бюрократов-реформаторов и мог бы испортить альянс на этой ранней стадии. И все же выбор должен быть сделан - и сделан тщательно."

 JAP_deal_with_the_devil_desc:0 "Кабинет полностью укомплектован.\n\nСостоящий из инноваторов и бюрократов, ориентированных на государство, это настоящий технократический кабинет, в котором представлены все ветви фракции. Заключить такую сделку с Дьяволом Сёва было сопряжено с риском - но до сих пор эти риски были смягчены ранними успехами.\n\nОднако проблемы должны решаться по одной за раз, и в течение этих первых лет мы будем уделять особое внимание военным. Если мы хотим привести Японию в новую славную эпоху, для этого потребуются вооружённые силы, соответствующие этим амбициям.\n\nИбо именно военные когда-то обеспечили наше господство, именно они помогли построить нашу Империю - и теперь необходимо будет убедиться, что они смогут её сохранить."

 JAP_deal_with_the_devil_scripted:0 "We have finally achieved our goal. After weeks of tiring negotiations and granting countless concessions, we have coerced the hardliners to support our cause. However, there is one thing left for us to accomplish. We must convene with the Showa No Yokai himself, and receive his ultimate approval.\\n\\nWhile Kishi has expressed support, he wishes to see the fruits of our labor. Once we show him the signed documents, he will most likely laugh heartily, and express his executive decision with a thumbs-up. §WThat is, if he doesn't request anything else.§!\\n\\n§YIf he does, that will be the final deciding factor. If we fail it, our work will be for naught, and the Reform Bureaucrats will be left to the hungry wolves, ready to dismember and devour wholeheartedly.§!\\n\\n§RLastly, remember that there is no return. It is either we comply and receive Lucifer's grace, or succumb to the fiery hell we find ourselves in.§!"
 JAP_on_our_own:0 "Сами по себе"
 JAP_on_our_own_desc:0 "Мы не будем кланяться владыкам. Мы не станем присягать какой-либо любой другой силе, слабее или сильнее нас. Мы не будем пересматривать наши реформы или идти на уступки, дабы успокоить наших оппонентов.\n\nНе стоит шутить с нашей партией. Наши планы не должны быть нарушены. Наши идеи не могут быть отринуты. Мы контролируем ситуацию. Мы не уступим тем, кто противостоит нам. Мы были избраны не просто так. Это наше право вести эту нацию и вести её к победе.\n\nМы возглавим обновление Японии и её народа в одиночку."
 JAP_forge_our_own_path:0 "Прокладываем свой собственный путь"
 JAP_forge_our_own_path_desc:0 "Фортуна благоволит смелым, тем, кто смотрит на проторенные пути и рискует проложить один для себя; мир меняется с головокружительной скоростью, и лучшая надежда Каи на его видение Японии - это не раскол в кабинете министров, а тот кабинет, который разделяет его собственное видение и сумел приручить зверя, называемого Бюрократией в 30-х годах, Кадзуо Аоки?\n\nМежду сторонниками жёсткой линии Киси и слабым компромиссом независимый кабинет министров - лучшая надежда на истинный, надлежащий прогресс для нашей нации."
 JAP_standing_tall:0 "Стоящие во весь рост"
 JAP_standing_tall_desc:0 "Как и ожидалось, наше решение кабинета министров вызвало много удивления и насмешек в парламенте, в основном со стороны Киси и его собственной клики. Однако политика - это не игра, в которую нужно стремиться угодить всем, чтобы не предаваться самому мягкому упражнению в тщете. Однако фортуна - непостоянная хозяйка, которая может отнять столько, сколько дает, и отказывается от рациональности в неуместной вере в непобедимость. Наши следующие шаги будут очень осторожными, поскольку мы должны заверить Кидо и парламент в том, что мы будем удерживать традиционные столпы власти, на которых стоит наша нация.\n\nКонечно, о том, сколько мы будем делать, можно будет спорить в будущем, но как только Восходящее Солнце засияет так же ярко, как и тридцать лет назад, в конце концов, не так много будет обсуждаться."
 JAP_leading_by_example:0 "Лидерство на примере"
 JAP_leading_by_example_desc:0 "Как хорошо написанная математическая функция, наш кабинет нуждается в последнем факторе, прежде чем его можно будет воплотить в жизнь, в одном сияющем драгоценном камне, который тускло светит без должного внимания. Такео Фукуда, эксперт по фискальным вопросам, протеже Такаси и плод экономического чуда 30-х годов, выбранный нашими ближайшими соратниками и самим Кадзуо, станет последней деталью короны нового, развивающего направления мысли правительства Кая."
 JAP_rule_by_our_view_or_none:0 "Управление по нашей указке или никак"
 JAP_rule_by_our_view_or_none_desc:0 "С последней печатью одобрения новый кабинет министров был сформирован под вежливое одобрение парламента, поддержку бюрократов и фракции Такаги, и презрение Киси и его клики. Политика - эмоциональный зверь, но, как и зверя, её можно контролировать, кормить или морить голодом, пока она не станет прирученной, послушной, а главное - послушной. Новая Япония при Кае будет не той, которая вызовет трепет сабельным бряцанием или бесконечными компромиссами и закулисными сделками, а той, которая сможет продвинуть её к высотам, невиданным в начале века.\n\nНовый путь проложен, и пришло время проложить его, не оставляя следов."
 JAP_realpolitik:0 "Реальная политика"
 JAP_realpolitik_desc:0 "Ассоциация помощи трону - хищный зверь, который выплевывает и пережевывает всех, кто думает, что может полностью контролировать его; замаскированная сцена подковерных интриг, сплетен и предательств отмечает его историю, имена тех, кто достаточно глуп, чтобы встретиться с ним лицом к лицу, написаны на стенах, как, например, Хирота Коки.\n\nМы не повторим эту ошибку. Пришло время обналичить некоторые услуги."
 JAP_talk_with_ikeda:0 "Беседа с Икедой"
 JAP_talk_with_ikeda_desc:0 "Масаносукэ Икеда имеет огромное влияние на клику влиятельных корпоративистов, это ресурс, который, будучи задействованным, может принести огромный политический капитал правительству Каи. Назначение должно быть сделано для того, чтобы Икеда был уверен, что его нынешние и будущие проблемы будут услышаны.\n\nПоэтому Сёдзиро Кавасима будет назначен руководить Министерством внутренних дел. Принципы АПТ, несомненно, будут неукоснительно соблюдаться правительством."
 JAP_listen_with_kido:0 "Слушайте Кидо"
 JAP_listen_with_kido_desc:0 "Кидо и его группа политической элиты - ещё одна фракция, с которой необходимо иметь дело, чтобы сохранить стабильность нашего правительства. К счастью, мы сможем удовлетворить их достаточно легко; обещания защитить власть Джушин от будущих реформ, вероятно, будет достаточно, чтобы удержать их на нашей стороне в обозримом будущем.\n\nНадеюсь, тогда мы оба сможем взаимно следить за интересами друг друга.  "
 JAP_bend_to_pressure:0 "Изгиб под давлением"
 JAP_bend_to_pressure_desc:0 "Аоки - человек, который одновременно обладает глубоким пониманием внутренних махинаций АПТ и занимает место в самом сердце правительства. Он сделал свое присутствие ощутимым, призывая Каю следовать примеру различных аналитических центров Ассоциации, умиротворяя Икеду в процессе.\n\nСо стороны премьер-министра было бы разумно уступить давлению."
 JAP_pragmatism_reigns_supreme:0 "Господство прагматизма"
 JAP_pragmatism_reigns_supreme_desc:0 "Искусство компромисса - невероятно тонкое искусство, и это утверждение подтверждается разочаровывающей теплой реакцией, ожидаемой после формирования нового кабинета министров. Это будет кабинет, ограниченный различными компромиссами, сделанными для его создания, однако премьер-министр сохраняет уверенность.\n\nБудь то через бюрократию или министерства, Кая преодолеет ограничения прагматизма и добьется своего."
 JAP_begin_the_reforms:0 "Начать реформы"
 JAP_begin_the_reforms_desc:0 "Премьер-министр твердо убежден, что экономический рост должен обеспечиваться, прежде всего, государством; однако, несмотря на всю его уверенность, его убеждения не пользуются широкой популярностью среди остальных власть имущих. Невозможно избежать того, что потребуется много убеждений, чтобы объединить правительство в поддержку возвращения к экономической политике 1930-х годов.\n\nПока что можно делать лишь предварительные шаги в ожидании грядущих скачков."
 JAP_intergrate_the_military:0 "Интегрировать военных"
 JAP_intergrate_the_military_desc:0 "К сожалению, военные остаются зверем, с которым трудно бороться. С одной стороны, он должен научиться работать с нами, однако, с другой стороны, его нельзя полностью вылечить из-за боязни разрушить статус-кво, жёсткого и твердого против любой угрозы оттуда. Постоянный поток изменений приведёт вооруженные силы всё ближе к нашему контролю."
 JAP_court_the_generals:0 "Уступки генералам"
 JAP_court_the_generals_desc:0 "Хотя и высшие чины Императорской армии глубоко разделены друг с другом, Кая сохраняет оптимизм в отношении того, что большинство офицеров можно привлечь на его сторону. Для достижения этого должна быть предложена сильная политика в отношении безопасности Маньчжурии и Кореи. Кроме того, сохранение стабильности в этих ключевых регионах будет иметь решающее значение для поддержания доброй воли армии."
 JAP_dine_with_admirals:0 "Ужин с адмиралами"
 JAP_dine_with_admirals_desc:0 "Адмиралтейство обеспокоено возможностью того, что Япония упустит своё господствующее положение на мировой арене, не меньше, чем их коллеги в армии. Придётся давать дополнительные обещания, чтобы они тоже оставались спокойными.\n\nБудут даны гарантии более сильной обороны в критически важном регионе Юго-Восточной Азии, в частности, на Филиппинах и в Индонезии."
 JAP_the_civilians_will_learn:0 "Гражданские научатся"
 JAP_the_civilians_will_learn_desc:0 "Последствия наших обещаний военным начали проявляться. Медленно армия вновь заявляет о себе в Корее, Маньчжоу-Го и Гуандуне, по мере того как всё больше средств начинает вливаться в связанные с военными бюрократии и компании. Кроме того, в эти регионы направляются свежие солдаты, и жители этих мест скоро вспомнят своё место."
 JAP_the_might_of_our_military:0 "Мощь нашей армии"
 JAP_the_might_of_our_military_desc:0 "Когда вооружённые силы уверены в своем положении в режиме, премьер-министр может продолжать продвигать своё видение реформ, проводимых государством, будучи уверенным в том, что мощь вооружённых сил на его стороне; или, по крайней мере, слишком заняты в других местах, чтобы бросить вызов его авторитету. Лишь время покажет, как долго продержится такая договорённость."
 JAP_political_cleansing:0 "Политическая чистка"
 JAP_political_cleansing_desc:0 "Собрав кабинет и приручив две ветви вооружённых сил, соперничающие фракции внутри АПТ должны последовать их примеру. Кнутом или пряником не может быть оппозиции правлению премьер-министра.\n\nНаши цели варьируются от реформистов во главе с Такаги, консерваторов во главе с Икедой и сторонников жёсткой линии, частично управляемых Нобусукэ Киси. Любая из этих фракций может быть устранена путём уступок или конфронтации, однако нападение на фракцию, составляющую значительную часть нашего кабинета, обречёт премьер-министра на своём посту."
 JAP_preserve_the_kotukai:0 "Сохранить котукай"
 JAP_preserve_the_kotukai_desc:0 "В очередной раз оказывается, что извращённые идеалы социализма были внедрены в нашу нацию с помощью иностранного вмешательства и влияния. Эти отвратительные концепции должны быть вырваны из Японии с корнем до основания, прежде чем слишком много наших граждан будут развращены.\n\nКабинету министров была предложена федеральная пропагандистская инициатива, поощряющая сообщения о подозреваемых социалистах и укрепление национальной автаркии, и то обязательно должно пройти без особых проблем. Наверняка никто из наших высокопоставленных политиков не станет на сторону такой мерзости."
 JAP_take_names:0 "Взять на заметку"
 JAP_take_names_desc:0 "Трудно сказать, действительно ли реликтовые бюрократы из администрации Ино враги премьер-министра, но это не имеет значения. Япония - страна будущего, и наша бюрократия должна отражать этот факт.\n\nЭти престарелые профессионалы должны быть смещены со своих постов, чтобы они не наносили дальнейшего вреда нашему режиму своими устаревшими методами, и если они окажутся сторонниками группировкам наших врагов, тем лучше."
 JAP_make_lists:0 "Составить списки"
 JAP_make_lists_desc:0 "Каким-то образом, внутри нашей нации до сих пор остаются антиправительственные организации, будь то социалисты или любая другая мразь.

Кто-то может сказать, что сокращение государства противоречит нашим интересам в экономическом развитии под руководством государства, но что хорошего в инструменте, который не может делать именно то, что задумал его владелец?

Более того, считается, что Нитицу и другие химические фирмы также были упомянуты в законопроекте.\n\nВысокотехнологичная тяжелая промышленность, промышленное химическое производство и корпорации по производству электрооборудования занимают видное место в новой японской экономике - мы лишим себя будущих экономических успехов, если не обеспечим им место в будущем японском развитии.

"You see, he affiliates with a group called the "Nagoya Anarchists." I wouldn't ever have someone like that serving for me, let alone in the government." remarked Kishi.\n\n"Why? Akao has not done anything wrong so far." said Kaya. "Besides, who will replace him?"\n\n"Me." said Kishi, grinning from ear to ear. "But don't announce that publicly. I don't want to deal with a whirlwind of press."\n\nAt this moment, the pen held in Kaya's hand snapped. The feelings of exasperation had been building up ever since the meeting started. Whether it was Kishi's posturing or his snarky attitude, Kaya did not know. Next he felt a wave of anger wash over him. And there was only one way he could channel it.\n\n"Kishi. I don't appreciate you simply discarding people like that. While I understand he is a risk, he hasn't shown any signs of incompetence or ideological impasse. I suggest you end your attempts to appoint him. Now." said Kaya, glaring at Kishi with a rising tone in his voice.\n\n"My, my, dear Kaya. You seem to be looking a little red." said Kishi, laughing as he turned around and headed for the door. "I'll leave you to think about it, but don't forget about that little request. Do comply, or else all the things you've done these past few weeks will be for naught." With the door shut, Kaya was left to fume in his place, alone."

It's about something that's been troubling me these past few days." said Takagi, placing his hands on the table.\n\n"Go on. However, there's something bothering me as well. And I've heard things that might also be the cause of your concern."\n\nA few seconds of silence. "It's Kaya, isn't it?" exclaimed both simultaneously.\n\n"In every facet of the Diet itself, my agents have heard rumors spoken in hushed tones. It seems Kaya has formed a pact with Kishi."\n\n"Kishi?" questioned Takagi. "He seemed to always be friendly with Kaya. It would make sense for them to find common ground."\n\n"Indeed. Yet, there is another issue I'll bring up." said Kido, adjusting his glasses. "Kaya's reach is rapidly expanding, from the House of Representatives, to even the House of Peers itself. I fear that his agreements have gained him a grasp among the various influencers. If we do not stop him now, it may be too late before the entire Diet is filled to the brim with his underlings, allowing him to enact whatever he desires."\n\n"That is... distressing. I felt Kishi was bad business, and having him around the Prime Minister makes him even more dangerous." said Takagi.\n\n"But for now, we must lay low. Acting impetuously will see both of our bodies in some sideway alley. We mustn't let them catch wind of our plans. For now, we must gather some allies of our own."\n\n"Alright, but who will be willing to aid us?"\n\n"Several high-ranking officers still owe me some favors, and surely your status as Rear Admiral will be enough to enlist some on your side."\n\n"Sounds good." said Takagi.\n\n"Kido nodded, then recited a famous proverb in his noble tongue of kanbun:"

Tomioka yawned, and decided that he needed a bit of shut-eye. He slipped his cap in front of his face, and closed his eyes.\\n\\nA sudden knock on the door startled him. "Yes?" sheepishly replied Tomioka, quickly tidying his appearance.\n\n"This is Rear Admiral Sōkichi Takagi. Requesting permission to speak with you urgently."\n\nAs the door swung open, Takagi walked in, bowed, and sat down in front of Tomioka's table. "There's something I need to talk to you about." said Takagi. "It's Kaya. His influence has grown too powerful, making him a threat to even people like you and I. Besides, he's got Nobusuke Kishi breathing down his neck, a bad sign of things to come. I don't know what his plans are, but I don't want to sit around and wait. I need your help to discover what he'll do next."\n\nTomioka gulped. "Takagi, this is all so sudden. We have no indication that he'll harm us. Besides, what if we're caught?"\n\n"We will not be, Admiral Tomioka. This will all be secret. That is why I precisely need you. You're a high-ranking officer. With the right words, the others will understand and will be willing to partake in this operation." said Takagi, looking sternly into Tomioka's eyes.\n\nA sigh was heard from the Admiral, who then stood up and shook Takagi's hand. "Alright, alright. I'll see what I can do."\n\n"Good. Then I wish you the best of luck." said Takagi, saluting as he shut the door."

"With that regard, we must establish our own support base among our fellow peers."\n\n"If I may be allowed to say my piece," said Kaya's DPM, Akao Satoshi, "I believe it's best to work alongside one of the larger factions within the Diet. It would consume less of our time and effort. Besides that, we'll be receiving reliable backing, providing us with great insurance among the Diet." finished Satoshi.\n\nKaya shook his head in disagreement. "That's the thing. If we do collaborate, chances are they'll gain more from us more than we out of them. Remember, we may be a small fish in the big ocean, but we don't want to end up as their bottom feeders." said Kaya, grabbing a piece of paper and jolting something down. "Here." said Kaya, passing the sheet to Satoshi, "I've written down notable people who we can persuade to join us. Work with the rest of the cabinet in seeking these individuals out, alright?" requested Kaya.\n\n"Alright, let's see. Etsusaburo Shiina, Masanosuke Ikeda..." said Satoshi, his eyes scanning through the names. "Are you confident all of them could be convinced to help us?" said Satoshi, gazing back to Kaya. Kaya nodded, and assured him with a firm nod.\n\n"I see. In that case, we'll reach out to them, then report back as soon as possible." said Satoshi, bowing alongside the others. Shutting the door behind them, Satoshi's group now set off.\n\nThe hall outside was subjected to a plethora of sounds. Shoes squeaking against the polished marble, while the chatter of voices reverberated off the walls. Each member prepared accordingly, then split off. From four to three, three to two, two to one, and one to none. The once bellowing corridor now laid empty, and silence pranced around where the men had once been."

So far, he had expressed no sign of wishing to do so.\\n\\n"My lords, I have gathered you here to meet with me for a very simple reason. I wish to bring you news of things to come. During these next months, I intend to maximize the efficiency of this nation by whatever means necessary. The lingering traces of the old conservative government will be stripped away from the state and replaced. This is to be the beginning of a new era of Japanese politics.

Your support, connections and resources will be of great value to the government. I have no intention of making you my enemies. However, should you prove to be an obstacle, then I can assure that you will be swept away. There can be no place for resistance in the new Japanese state. In the near future, I ask that you all remember my words. It may be greatly beneficial for you to do so"\n\nBefore the Peers could object, Kaya departed from the table.

He rolled his shoulders to ease his tension, and began to speak with an intense whisper, masking his words so only those in the room could hear.\\n\\n"I've seen it far too often recently... Kishi, that monster; everywhere he goes, people disappear. He breathes down the Prime Minister's neck, whispering him sweet lies and daring threats. He is the Devil of Showa."\n\nThe men surrounding him nodded and murmured in agreement, putting out their cigarettes to divert their full attention to the conversation. They made comments supporting his claims; some of the officers noted Kishi's unwanted presence in and around IJA offices, as well as his ghostly charm around the disappearances of certain members of staff.

Undisciplined scoundrels like you deserve punishment... FIVE LAPS! NOW!" shouted Reo, swinging his staff at Moto's thigh. With a yelp, Moto began his second jog of the day.\n\nFinishing the final lap, Moto exhaustedly collapsed onto the grass. His vision blurred, colors turning monochrome. His hearing waned, as ringing overtook all noise. He wanted to call for help. He wanted to vomit. He couldn't do anything but watch as his world faded into black.\n\nA wave of cold water suddenly splashed his face. "Get up Private Moto! Practice starts soon!" yelled Sergeant Reo. "Here is your rifle. Make sure it doesn't break." said Reo. Moto only responded with a weak salute. As he looked down at the rifle however, he noticed something off.\n\n"Sergeant Reo. The rifle you gave me is defective." said Moto.\n\nHearing this, Reo stopped distributing the other soldier's rifles, pivoted around and stomped furiously until he faced Moto. He was fed up with Moto's behavior. He was ready to scream his lungs out. He was ready to send him to hell and back. As he raised his hand to slap Moto, Reo noticed the rifle he was carrying. It was significantly shorter than the rest of the guns issued alongside it. Its metal work seemed sloppy and unpolished, while the wooden frame splintered in several edges. Such poor quality, Reo imagined, would only be produced somewhere in a foreign sweatshop twenty years ago, during the war.\n\n"Everyone stay in position! Don't use your firearms in any circumstance!" ordered Sergeant Reo. He eyed the shoddy rifle with disdain as he marched off with it to the local mechanic."

To access the walkway they would move across while touring the facility, the inspectors and their guide were forced to climb a great number of stairs. The military inspectors could not help but notice how rusted most of the metal around the plant looked, especially on the very stairs they climbed. Upon finally reaching the top, the manager was keen to point out just how impressive the view was from up high. Far below, the plant's hundreds of workers were busy preparing ammunition at various stages of completion.\\n\\n"How Many hours do your staff work here each day?"\n\n"Ah yes, well due to the recent demand increases, most of our workers are here for around ten to twelve hours. That includes their break time."\n\nAt ground level, it became clear that rust and long hours were only some of the many problems. Within seconds, the inspectors noticed failing equipment, broken safetywear and even a few decades-old munition assembly machines. Closer inspection made it apparent that even the fully functional tools were quite old.\n\n"How are staff provided safety equipment here?"\n\n"Anything they break must be replaced out of their own salary"\n\nThe inspectors had nothing but concerned looks for the rest of the tour."

With a sinister grin, the powerful man nodded to the Prime Minister, before relaxing in a chair just opposite him.\\n\\n"You have brought much justice to our cause, Mr. Kaya. The Yokusankai is far more powerful than it has ever been. Of course, the factions have their uses, but their petty squabbles far remove them from what really matters - the premiership."\n\nKaya, intimidated by Kishi, nodded profusely and suppressed any sign of fear beneath a forced grin. Even as in his position, he could not afford to displease the man with the devilish smile, the Prime Minister thought. After all, he had seen what Kishi had done to people who had crossed him.\n\n"Yes, of course Mr. Kishi, the premiership. It is simply the most integral position to bring about change in the nation. The Reform Bureaucrats have really encouraged positive change across the empire, and I am so proud to sit in this seat representing that interest-"\n\n"Yes," Kishi sneered and he turned his nose up at the Prime Minister.

He nodded back at Takagi, confirming the outrageous statements.\n\n"Not only that, but he's using the Prime Minister to implement his policies whilst escaping public backlash. Kaya's being used, whether he knows it or not, by the sly bastard to cover his tracks. He's a danger, and the more time he's allowed to scurry about in the shadows, the more influential he'll get."\n\nBoth worried, they discussed their next moves to approach the threat Kishi posed to the nation.

The retired admiral expected a modicum of agreement for his proposal from Ikeda and Kido, but the two were curt and dismissive of his plans. The rift between them all would be near impossible to bridge, especially Kido, the ever-scheming visionary. Were it not for his friends in the Kazoku, he would have fallen from grace long ago.\\n\\nAnd as for Ikeda? He had refused to agree with any of their plans to weaken the hold on the zaibatsu, or the drastic anti-corruption measures needed to lessen the hold Baron Kishi and the Prime Minister held over the Imperial Army. In a moment that could have destroyed any potential cooperation, Masanosuke insulted Kido's sweeping reformist policy, claiming he wanted nothing more than Kishi; an end of the old Japan, and a new, unstable system centered around himself. It was only a well-timed suggestion of a recess by an aide of Ikeda's that had stopped the coalition from collapse.\\n\\nReturning to the room once again, the discussion was less explosive, but none of three men looked at the other with anything but suspicion, worry, or boredom. Through the night they began to propose answers, an actual strategy to confront the Prime Minister and create a true opposition to his government. As each departed from the government complex in their chauffeured cars, they were unsure how far they could trust their new allies, but the three men could at least put on a show of defiance to Kaya and Kishi."

Planes soared overhead in formation, performing evasive maneuvers as part of their drill, before dropping a number of blood-red flares onto the island. That was their cue.\\n\\nHe rushed over to the 25 millimeter anti-air guns, stumbling as the gun turrets fired off their shells, deafening him with each heavy thud. From the island, a number of balloons were let loose; target practice for the ship crews.\\n\\nBehind the gun's armor plates, his crewmate fed in new boxes of ammunition, while a spotter called out where to rotate the platform. The trail of bullets flew across the horizon, and the targets were all but neutralized in a matter of minutes. Catching his breath from the recoil, he saw landing craft move onto the beaches, the individual soldiers becoming little more than black specks as they sped on towards their target. Again the deck guns fired, and a pillar of sand and wooden debris spit out from the pristine coastline for a second. The landing ships unloaded as another set of balloons were sent drifting for the ships to target.\\n\\nThe wargame would continue for another day, as the combined forces of the Imperial Army and Navy were able to stage a successful operation on an enemy-occupied island. While the reports showed the anti-air gunners in the fleet did their job well, there was disappointment among high command about the speed of the Army, or so was the talk onboard. The sailors, proud men they were, onboard one of Japan's great ships, wouldn't dare admit any shortcomings; nor would the officers.\\n\\nTokyo deemed the results satisfactory enough, as Prime Minister Kaya approved a number of bills to increase expenses for such exercises, and their wargame would now be a biennial drill involving all members of the Co-Prosperity Sphere to instruct and test the newest doctrines thought up in the military academies."

They still fawned over Meiji nearly a century later, thankful his reforms did not remove them of their privileged status.\\n\\nHe spoke to the hundreds before him for his case, to support the current administration against the liberals like Takagi and the entrenched conservative wings of the Yokusankai, though he was careful to not name anyone in particular. Yes these were to be changes, but changes that would launch Japan into the great nation that it was destined to be; the future that millions had fought and worked for, could only be achieved through his careful maneuvering.\\n\\nAnd the Kokutai, oh how the old men loved to hear of it! Kaya emphasized throughout his speech of its importance, that the national identity, no, the national body of Japan would not be warped like the ideologies of the Americans and Germans. The Prime Minister will keep the essence of both the state and Emperor alive through his work, and their own co-operation. He was met with the traditional applause the nobility would give, slow and restrained, but he could sense they were now on his side. And the Kokutai, to him and anyone of importance, was now saved."

Their names reaches from city mayors to career officers, and everyone in between. Such a vast number of enemies was to be expected, Kaya thought to himself. His victory was won on a knife's edge, and had been teetering ever since. To boot out so many prominent figures so quickly would be of extraordinary risk. He turned to his own, personal list of opponents to clean out the Yokusankai. It was far smaller than the novels of enemies brought before him by his staff, a single admiral.\\n\\nTakagi Soukichi.\\n\\nContent, he handed the dossier back to an aide outside his office.

Kido met in secret with his own band in the Yokusankai, reminding them that the Reform Bureaucrats had managed to clean out a noticeable portion of the Liberals in the House of Representatives. Were they to sit back, there would be no doubt any message of the Emperor would get through to the Japanese government. Neither Ikeda nor Kido considered this united opposition more important than protecting their friends from suspicious policemen sent from Kaya himself, but the danger was imminent.

Kishi stated bluntly to the Prime Minister, who had poured himself a tall cup of green tea from a pot brought into the room. Kaya nodded in agreement, before pulling out a folder from the briefcase leaning against his chair.\n\n"Indeed, Kishi-san. I had not expected Kido-san to mobilize so quickly with Representative Ikeda. With all of this in the news our chance to strike at every threat at once is growing smaller." The folder contained a full list of names: Takagi's insubordinate admirals, the upstart representatives, Kido's allies in the House of Peers, anyone who could take away power from the Prime Minister. To pull it all off would be a miracle beyond compare, but to back down would mean the wrath of his closest allies.\n\nKishi flipped through the pages, stopping at some high-level bureaucrat before commenting, "He has a third possible location. Ishimoto-san invited me to his coastal home many times before his promotions. Make sure your men are aware of this." Kishi poured himself from the pot, watching intently as Kaya made note of the altered plan. "Otherwise, we will proceed tomorrow."\n\n"Tomorrow seems almost too hasty-"\n\nHe was cut off by Kishi. Tomorrow it would be, then. The two spent another hour reviewing their operations a final time, before Kishi exited the office. And tomorrow, the arrests would come."

Newspapers in Tanaka's constituency, as well as in Tokyo, have reported of the inappropriate behavior of the police force, and questioned why the Prime Minister is related to this situation.

Kaya's hands seized the nearest envelope, fingers digging in like teeth biting into flesh. "May I open them?"\n\n"Of course, Kaya-san."\n\nA crack, as he disarmed the letters from the Emperor's protection. Sheets of paper, neatly-typed lines. Lists that seemed to go on forever and ever, correlating the specific nobles with their individual sins. Some border on the ludicrous, but all were as plausible as the authority of the author: the Prince himself. "These are all marvelous, Prince Takeda." Kaya leaned back, pleased. "Very marvelous.

The dances of the ceilings and chandeliers amid the drizzle met the muffled huff of politicians preparing for the promulgation of a new law.\\n\\n"You know, Kaya." Kishi said, standing by his protege near a window, observing the rain as it sprayed the fields of the Diet building in waves upon waves carried by the fierce wind. "'Law for the Restoration of the Economy' is a good name. Good enough for what I - we - have in store." He watched as a pedestrian bounded to the nearest cover, her heels digging into the rain-drenched streets, up, down, up, down, dispersing water in her wake. "It is impossible to please everyone. You know this as well as I do."\n\n"The Yokusankai does not like the idea." Kaya said, tapping the windowsill. "The nobility is displeased. I don't know, Kishi-san.

A shrill quiet draped itself over the sounds and noises of the courtyards, the trees rustling as if in nervous unease.\\n\\nYet within one of the building's many forgotten corners, the work of government had not yet ceased. With a lone electric light illuminating their work, its footmen set out to type names - traitors, corrupt politicians under the zaibatsus' and keiretsus' payroll. The typewriters' melodic cackles seemed in synchrony with the bootheels clacking against the lacquered wooden floor-boards. Hushed voices spoke as if shamed by surreptitiousness.\\n\\nAbove it all, Prime Minister Okinori Kaya observed the cabinet's comings and goings, nothing escaping his stare. Kishi might be his master, but Kaya was also a bureaucrat. He was in his element amid the lines of paper and blackmail blurring into one cohesive whole: a graven image of all the traitors to the nation, those who sold the divine Kokutai to the machinations of lowly profiteers.\\n\\nWhen dawn finally arrived, the Prime Minister ordered his clerks to clear out. Tomorrow was the day of cleansing. Japan shall burn, its structures reduced to cinders - and only those left standing shall be worthy of the new order that Kaya and Kishi had envisioned.

Any and all that you say can and will be used against you within the court of law." If it were any other sunny day in Tokyo, Masaharu would have gone to work - instead, the police knocked on his doors, carrying him away dressed in his pajamas. It was a humiliation, and the neighbors looked with second-hand embarrassment.\n\nThe officer threw him into the paddy wagon, and none too gently. His knees rang against the metal bed. Masaharu rose to explain, but the back slammed itself shut before his eyes. He sighed, and his eyes adjusted to the darkness. If the officer would not listen to his protestations, perhaps he could share his woe with his fellow prisoners-to-be. Men, old and young, in various states of dress, trembled, afraid to even speak. Masaharu recognized a few faces. They mostly belonged in the corporate lobby of the Yokusankai: liberals, conservatives, and even a Kidoite sitting close to the wagon's cabin, furthest from Masaharu.\n\nA morbid joke sprang itself unto his mind. 'What are you in for?' Masaharu did not know, but perhaps these men would know. He tried to get their attention, to pull them away even slightly from the world of chaos and fear. Yet, no one answered. It seemed that guilt was universal among the inhabitants of the paddy wagon. Masaharu scratched his head and waited until the station came into view. He was the last arrest of the day."

Regardless, a recording machine, with tapes tuned to every signal of the microphone, stood atop the lone table, regarding the aging Diet deputy with its eyes: twin spools containing its reels.\\n\\nMasaharu answered every question truthfully. They first made him swear an oath to the state and emperor, which he found to be bombastic but he conceded. Now, did he receive money from Zaibatsus or Keiretsus? No, they could check his account transfer history. Did he propagate subversive attacks against the state? No, Masaharu was not a socialist, much less an anarchist. Did he have any inklings as to why he was there? Nope, and he hopes that he could obtain legal counsel - the way the Tokyo PD had handled his case seemed on the edge of brusque and abusive.\\n\\nDid he have names? No. On and on the last question came, like waves trying to erode a rock. Names. Names. Names. No. No. No. At the end of it, however, Masaharu caved. If they wanted the names of the corporate stooges, here they go. Just one thing - leniency. At this, the police sergeant gave him a smirk. Lenience, he should have. They brought a typewriter into the room and churned out lines after lines of "corrupt" officials for the Kaya administration to arrest. After that, they returned him to his cell, the sergeant thanking him for his cooperation."

 japkaya.35.d:0 "It had been three days since Masaharu saw the sun. He glimpsed at it: its rays penetrated the window-bars of his prison, and sometimes he would raise himself unto his bed, trying to feel. The food was terrible. The rice was crumbly and hard, and Masaharu's brittle teeth could not bite into them. When exercise time came, Masaharu could barely keep up with the younger inmates, who made fun of him. "What are you in for?" echoed in the halls whenever Masaharu came near. He had refused to tell anyone the actual cause of his imprisonment because he himself did not know why.\n\nThe police brought inmates in today. The skies were heavily overcast, and the new fish - not Masaharu's preferred terminology - marched forward, eyes downwards. Masaharu saw his fellow convicts jeer and shout at the arrivals, criticizing everything, from their clothing and possessions. It must have been cathartic for them, Masaharu thought. Three days in any prison acquaints a man's minds to hate people who bring aspects of the "outside world" which meant glimpses of freedom. At times, it signaled a world that was changing, and no one here was any part of it.\n\nWhen they returned Masaharu to his cell, he saw a young man occupy the bottom bunk. Masaharu knew him. He was in one of the lists that he gave. It seemed that the keepers of this place had a penchant for poetic justice. Trembling, Masaharu tried to strike up a conversation.

The joke elicited a smirk from Takagi. "Well, I am not happy with the current state of things, and I bet the navy establishment wouldn't, either."\n\nTakagi sat up. "You are the navy establishment, Tomioka."\n\n"Interesting remark, Takagi-san. Well, the Navy would like a change of air. A different person in charge, you see. No one is happy with the current status quo. Politicians getting arrested and all that: it feels suitably like the 40s again." Tomioka looked down. "Those were troubling times. Yet, neither we nor the Army can nominate a Prime Minister - look at what happened to Hideki Tojo's Ministry." He seemed to shudder. "Not that again. The Yokusankai is preferable to what happened then. Luckily," he regarded Takagi with a sharp eye. "I have just the right man for the job."\n\n"Still, how do you plan on taking out the government? With the fat checks they are paying the Army with, as well as blackmail material, political arrests - it seems that the odds are against us."\n\n"The Meiji Constitution. Topple the government with the resignation of the Army and Navy Ministers. Kaya will wake up one day and find the resignation letters on his desk. Then you will make your move.

Through the dusty, dirty windows, Takagi could see the sun's reddening rays as it approached the horizon, ready to set. His meeting was with a young army major, one of the commanders of Yokohama's local protection force.\\n\\n"Major," Takagi called out as he saw the figure of a man he had been looking for. "Nice to see you." He extended out his hand, only to be met with a cold, cynical gaze. When the major did return this gesture, it was with lethargy and languor. They sat down and ordered food. In the meantime, Takagi examined the Major. Army uniform, not much older than 32. Must be an overachiever or something.\n\nThe major broke the silence. "It is unusual for the sea winds to blow landwards in this time of chaos," he said, eyeing Takagi. "Although the Army cannot say that it is pleased with the current status-quo. The Prime Minister," he mumbled looking over his shoulders as he did so. "pleases the Army with maneuvers and the like. However, his true intent is clear: the control of the armed forces is subsumed under his control. Takagi-san." He said, looking at the admiral straight in the eye.

In a cafe within the gentrified districts of Tokyo, the Admiral meets the Marquess. A low light hung above, ensconced within a chandelier. The warm and bawdy smell of coffee drifted from table to table. Nobles sat down and departed, almost without notice. Everything was quiet, except for the whisperings of a few patrons.\n\n"What do you think happened?" Kido said, his eyebrows arched. "Several nobles are on the run. Some swore off politics, and the Emperor seemingly did not care for the fate of his kin. This is a disaster." Taking a perfumed handkerchief from his coat pockets, Kido wiped the sweat that lathered his face. "I suppose, there is still one avenue to solve this problem." Kido laid his eyes on Takagi as if sizing him for the first time. "I suppose you would do. I dislike liberal politics, but I can support your candidacy."\n\n"How did y-"\n\n"I have eyes and ears everywhere, Admiral. I know that you've had contacts and dealings with the Army and the Navy.

"Kishi and his pawn don't go here," Satou said, as they walked closer to the street-stand. "Too cheap for their blood." He gave a chuckle, but neither Ikeda nor Takagi laughed. Still, warm food made Takagi's eyes water.\n\n"Yes," Takagi said. "What the Prime Minister doesn't realize is that this is not his game." He hushed his voice. "The Army and the Navy are ready to make their move. They will pull their ministers in a few weeks, and that will be our opportunity to spring our trap."\n\n"Our?" Ikeda said. "Takagi-san, I apologize, but you're assuming things a bit too far. I suggest taking it back slightly." Then he became quiet. "Although I suppose I would not be opposed to your candidacy. I don't have any power within the Diet, not anymore. Kishi's pawn tears the conservatives to bits, turning good politicians into corrupt bureaucrats."\n\n"We'll see, Ikeda-san.""

I thought that the Diet building is accessible to all - whether Peer or Deputy." Ikeda would not have even gone near the lounge if not for the dire political circumstances. The maroon-tinted cushions did not sit well with him, and nor did the golden-framed chairs and sofas.

"Pardon me, but the people in hiding cannot help but be austere. These are hard, dark times. May I pour you water?" Ikeda nodded, and water sloshed out from a pitcher, filling both men's cups. They sat in the Tomioka residence's dining-room, the second-most politician in the Diet face-to-face with a known criminal, a dissident. Or at least how the Kaya government termed them to be.\n\n"It was not a bad dinner, all things considered." Ikeda said. "For a fugitive, you seem to be eating well. How are you these days?"\n\n"I could be much worse in so many ways. In prison, for example. I'd say I am well. How are the liberals in the Diet? Are the old boys doing all right?"\n\n"They arrested Nakasone. On trumped-up charges, I presume. Other than that, they are doing somewhat decently. The Prime Minister is giving them a hard time, though."\n\n"I heard." Takagi sat up, crossing his fingers before him. "Ikeda-san, I need your help. This predicament is bad for us both. If the liberals and conservatives vote together, we can bring forth a new government. Only in cooperation and unity can we stand against this threat."\n\n"I presume that you have the means to topple the government? I tried the navy and the army, but both seem unresponsive."\n\n"Don't worry about that. I've got all bases covered, except for the conservatives."\n\nIkeda sighed. "Very well. In this matter, I'll let you take charge. Remember, admiral, that I will be watching your government."\n\n"I'll hate to disappoint you.""

He and Ikeda sat in his home's living room, watching the day's furor unfold live on television. The breaking news segment attempted to explain the causes behind the Navy's resignation and disapproval of the cabinet until someone handed the presenter a piece of paper. All was silent, and Ikeda was at the edge of his seat. What was going to happen next? Where does the Army stand?\n\nThe news presenter, a man of indistinct youth, read the paper. Panning his eyes level to the camera, he seemed to stammer before gathering his composure. "The Army minister has just resigned." Ikeda picked up the remote and switched the TV off. The image halted, compressing together from top-to-bottom until it became a single line. After that, it faded.\n\n"I was watching that!" Tomioka said, annoyed.\n\n"I had seen enough, Admiral. Your friend will have the confidence to form a new government, I am sure."\n\nTomioka sat back, sighing. "Oh well, at least I have seen what I needed to see." He turned to face Ikeda. "I am curious, Ikeda-sama. What do you plan on doing now? I can't imagine the leader of the conservatives to sit by and do nothing."\n\n"We will go with the agreement previously enforced," Ikeda said, his voice turning cold. "I trust your friend would do the same?"\n\nTomioka guffawed. "He would not be a navy man otherwise."

Occasionally, a flash of lightning would run its way through. In the middle of this grey day, however, the eminence grise seemed cheerful, almost uncharacteristically so."\n\n"You look happy today, Marquess Kido." Ikeda said. "Is that the reason for your invitation?"\n\n"Yes." Kido, said, cordially. It was most irregular: Kido was not a man of straightforward notions. "Today is Prime Minister Kaya's resignation day. I watched him deliver the letter to the Emperor. The bureaucrat could not even meet His Imperial Majesty's gaze. What a failure!"\n\n"Did you handle your part in the House of Peers?"\n\n"Handle them? It was more like as if I had set a lit match upon a barrel of saltpeter. It did not take much work to persuade the Peers to set down and dismember Kaya's attempts to reform his government. All I had to do was give them a slight push." Kido turned to Ikeda. "Tomorrow is Takagi's moment to form his government. I presume that you will vote following us?"\n\n"You need not doubt my honesty, Marquess."

 japkaya.49.d:0 "The day after the nobles dismembered any chance of Kaya maintaining his government, the Diet gathered to vote into confidence a new government. In the amphitheater-shaped inner chamber of the Diet building, Takagi stood at the frontmost and central lectern, directly facing the Deputies from all over Japan. Ikeda sat far back, his clique practically comprising the backbenchers of the Taisei Yokusankai. To his right, he saw the defeated and ashen faces of the Reform Bureaucrats. Kaya was nowhere to be seen. Ikeda would later hear that the disgraced former Prime Minister had requested leave.\\n\\nStanding on his podium, Takagi addressed the rows and rows of politicians that make up the upper crust of Japanese democracy. His words made no impression on Ikeda's mind; it should have been the conservatives who rule the chamber, and thus the state. At this juncture, however, what can you do, he thought. Takagi promised reform: firstly, an end to the politicized violence, and secondly, the release of political prisoners arrested on wrongful charges made by the previous government.\\n\\n"I would like to thank my fellow Deputies," Takagi's sudden words met Ikeda's mind with a searching, dull echo, "Kouichi Kido-san and Masanosuke Ikeda-san. Without their help, I would not have reached the same resolve to form a government to replace what was lost." It was a nice gesture, but it did not dissolve the feeling of disappointment in Ikeda's heart, which lay in its whole, enormous shape, like a giant hunk of salt.\n\nThen they voted. The conservatives, Kidoites, and liberals voted as one, a majority. The old government had gone out; another was coming in, like ships leaving and entering ports."

 japkaya.100.d:0 ""Welcome to your new office, Prime Minister Kaya. Hope it serves you well." said the secretary before quickly walking away. The room itself was nothing luxurious. It was medium-sized, modest, and plain, just the way he liked it. As Kaya sat down on the black velvet chair, he began to think. His mind drifted off, imagining Japan under his tenure, recovered and reinvigorated. "Prime Minister, we have some matters to discuss." a voice boomed, throwing Kaya back into reality. For now, he noted, such thoughts remained wistful thinking.\n\n"Regarding the status of your cabinet" mentioned one advisor, "We have mostly filled out their positions with dignitary individuals. Feel free to look at their portfolios here and please do bring up any concerns. We will try our best to resolve them." "Thank you, I will attend to these shortly." said Kaya "However, our biggest concern as of late is our support base. I'm sure you're all aware of our popularity during the election campaigns." All heads nodded in agreement. "We are but one of the many camps within the Yokusankai, and there were some candidates who had larger support from within the government and the people, yet we won despite all that." Kaya continued, "While we have made it this far, we cannot continue further unless we find external support in order to ensure we still remain on top in the following months."\n\n"...with that, our meeting has been completed. Thank you all for your time, and you are now dismissed." stated Kaya, closing the hour-long session. As the advisors shuffled out of the room, Kaya stared back down again at his notes. There was an outline for three potential choices he could make. He could use his contacts with the hardline Reform Bureaucrats, or he could approach his opposition, Ikeda and Kido, or by good examples and fulfilled promises, he could earn the support of the Diet and the people. Kaya slumped back on his chair, thinking of his next move."

However, favors like these come at a price, and we hope you'll be able to pay it upfront." said Satou with a hint of menace in his tone.\n\nKaya stiffened up, then responded back. "Satou-sama," said Kaya "no burden is too much to bear if one wishes to achieve success. However, I cannot accept your offer unless what I receive is equal in value. Allow me to speak directly to your leader so we may negotiate on equal terms." Kaya reached for his phone then rotated its dial, and soon waited for the line to pick up.\n\n"...consider it done. However, would you like me to send other things as well? I'm sure additional manpower would be of great use to you." said the voice on the other end with a light chuckle.\n\n"No, thank you. Our positions are fully manned." said Kaya "However, don't forget to guarantee us some help in gaining some support, while we will uphold our end and grant Teiichi Suzuki a seat in the Diet and position of Economic Minister."\n\nThe voice chuckled once more, "Easier said than done, see you soon my friend."

"The economic crisis brought by the collapse of Yasuda was catastrophic, its aftershock still felt to this day." said Suzuki, pointing to graphs with statistics of various industries affected by the collapse. "However, I have devised a solution, which shall see rapid regrowth and ensures Japan reaches her pre-crisis levels, or..." he paused dramatically, "even possibly higher." Small murmurs began, then a hand slowly rose from the audience. It was Takami Eto, a member from the House of Representatives.\n\n"Excuse me, Suzuki-san, but I object to these proposals of yours. It is all simply too much." Eto stated. "As your fellow peer, I suggest these plans be toned down a bit. If it won't make it through here, how much better will it fare with everyone else?" Several people in the room nodded in agreement. Suzuki firmly shook his head and replied sternly.\n\n"No." he stated "I offered myself to alleviate this crisis as quickly as possible, and this is how I'm treated?" said Suzuki enraged, angrily striking his pointing stick at the board. "I will see the start and end of this, and I will not be stopped by anyone, be it the public or the politicians!"\n\nA long silence, followed by loud grumbling. Suzuki glanced at Eto, loudly fuming in his place. Despite the rabblet, Prime Minister Kaya remained silent, showing no apparent signs of disdain or disappointment. Suzuki now wondered if Kaya would still help him achieve his goals, or would he retract his support and leave him in the dust, prey to his fellow cabinet members. He would have to find out soon."

His beady eyes shifted to Kaya, awaiting a response.\n\n"Good sir, no need for confrontation. Do you realize these plans are essential? Don't you see the benefits they bring?" said Kaya. A stony stare indicated uninterest. Kaya sighed, and spoke again. "Forget your views, think logically. Ponder the good it will do to you, I, and the countless people. Economy, prestige, and everything in between will return, a thousand times fold."\n\n"Do you honestly expect me to believe such deceit? Even with your position as Prime Minister, I can't tolerate such decadence. I demand you revise these plans, immediately." said the portly man, slamming his hand onto the table.\n\n"I realize this entire meeting is pointless. Why do I seek a pillar to lean on, instead of creating my own? My proposals, once implemented, will garner me enough support, meaning I won't need the help from you or your accomplices. Go file complaints all you want, I don't care. None of it changes the fact I have the final say. You are dismissed, thank you for your time."\n\nThe bald official stood in confusion and reacted only seconds later. He bared his teeth and cried out in frustration. "The Emperor shall know and you'll be detained! You're not safe, Okinori!" spoke the fat man, jabbing a finger into Kaya's chest. He stomped out, slamming the door behind him in anger.

 japkaya.109.d:0 "With the announcement of his appointment as Prime Minister, Kaya had scouted the vast landscape of the Taisei Yokusankai in hopes of gathering potential alliances to cement himself in these unstable circumstances. Kaya searched left and right, deeming individuals who could be helpful in his mission to gain support not only from the politicians in the backrooms of the Imperial Diet, but the general populace in all of Japan as well.\\n\\nNews sources arriving from the Diet Building itself indicates that Kaya was willing to accept people, regardless of background, who devote their efforts to his government and pledge their support for him, with their compensation of "certain" influence within the proposals placed forward. With this turnout, many within the party have stated their distaste and are skeptical of this policy, as it could potentially attract radical or undesirables lurking within the framework of the bureaucracy which could destabilize the cabinet and cripple its effectiveness. Despite this, Kaya previously stated that this is necessary to improve the government and rectify the previous government's misdoings.\n\nAs the news broadcast played in the background, Kaya and his close associates confided and began to whisper in hushed tones. The many voices muddled together and spoke in unison "Are you sure this is the right decision? What would happen if this fails? You'd be in hot water if your plan goes awry. Please, reconsider, for the sake of the party." After a period of silence, Kaya began to speak.\n\n"Gentlemen, I can assume you, the situation is under control. This will not jeopardize any of us. Let us think rationally. We are merely a small cub in the lion's den. We will not survive a day alone."

This, however, wasn't the short barrage typical of the officials, but a single powerful knock enough for him to get the message. "Come in, I've been expecting you," said Kaya. He gestured for his guest to take a seat. "It's been some time since we last talked in person, hasn't it?" Kaya continued. "Please make yourself comfortable, Ikeda-san."\n\nIkeda began to speak. "It has been a while indeed. However, I'd like to drop formalities for a moment. I have a concern, particulary with your plans for the future." Ikeda took a few seconds to think before he spoke. "I must ask you to cut down on your militaristic outlook. It's all too much. We live in a time of peace, and surely there is no need for such aggresive talk, is there? We must focus on rebuilding the economy first and foremost," he stated. Ikeda coughed, then went on. "In return, I'll extend my support to you. I have many friends in many circles, and they can drum up some support for you if you help in kind. You can be assured of that much." Ikeda smiled.\n\nBut he was not yet finished. "There is another matter. You must also preserve some men in high positions, colleages of mine who I have faith in. Don't worry - they shall not contest your position. However, I will need them there in light of the conservatives' position in the Diet."\n\nKaya raised an eyebrow. Two tall orders had been asked of him, and realistically he couldn't agree to both. He would have to disappoint Ikeda by choosing one concession over the other. The question was, which one?"

"Come, let us discuss the future of Japan."\n\n"Did you even schedule an appointment? I heard you merely showed up, walked past my secretary and headed straight for my office," said Kaya, staring dispassionately.\n\nKido shrugged in response. "The details don't matter. What matters is our discussion," said Kido. "You've mentioned the need for support. Well, I offer my hand to you. I will ensure your ministry doesn't fall apart," Kido smiled. "Of course, I expect something in return." His voice dropped, any semblance of emotion gone. "As you know, I am a member of the House of Peers, and a very powerful individual. I could make a good ally," said Kido. "Being friends will benefit both of us. But this can only happen if you sideline Kishi. He is, frankly, a very radical thinker. He's not someone I want to work with. If you do push him away, I'm more than willing to work closely with you. If you don't accept, I'm afraid you're on your own." Having concluded his offer, Kido's bubbly facade returned. It was positively unnerving.\n\nKaya was distraught by the offer. He knew Kido was a close associate of the Emperor, and wielded power in the House of Peers because of it. Having someone like that could be beneficial as insurance in case his support dwindled. On the other hand, Kido was no friend to him, and Kishi was. Would he drag Kishi through the mud just to save himself?\n\nAs Kaya made up his mind he looked at Kido sternly, as the other drummed his hands on the table impatiently, waiting for a response. "Listen here, Kido. I've decided that..."

We can help ensure your term does not come to an end soon, but you'll have to do something for us..."\n\n"What do you want?" returned Kaya.\n\n"Consider this a gift, which will help you to stabilize your position for a bit longer." The man gazed at Kaya intensely. "We've drawn up a few proposals. Make your choice, Prime Minister."\n\nSilently, Kaya looked over his potential options on his sheets of paper and decided. Each option offered stung; his pride and status were under attack by some short buffoon. Despite the posturing however, Kaya suppressed his anger as he read over the paper. Internally, he allowed a brief fantasy of violence against the ringleader of the Kouktai. Kaya would make sure that man would pay, all in due time.\n\n"What will it be this time, Mr. Prime Minister?" said the bald man snidely, as his accomplices leered."

Despite this, the Prime Minister before him hadn't even bothered to change them. "But why? Why haven't they been changed? Why have they been left to rot on these pieces of paper?" Kaya thought as he shuffled through the paperwork.\n\nHis train of thought was interrupted as his secretary entered the room with a cup of tea. "Thank you," said Kaya. The secretary nodded silently and left the office, leaving Kaya to his throughts once more. Kaya drank the tea quickly, then returned to the seemingly unending work of editing and revising policies rendered useless by the passage of time, to be replaced by new ones more beneficial to the interests of Japan and, by extension, the Sphere.\n\nSeveral hours later, Kaya allowed himself a small sigh of satisfaction. He had drawn an outline for the revision of several policies, and several new ones he would announce in time. With this, he hoped that the mistakes of before would not be repeated through him.

It was just a simple list of names, yet, for some reason, Kaya felt something stir in him as he wrote.\\n\\nSome of them Kaya had known for years. Many were dear friends, as well as his co-partners, who spent long strenuous hours of time working with him. Whether they bickered or gotten angry at each other once or twice, but Kaya knew they always held each other in high regard. Kaya remembered his days as a fledgling official, stumbling his way around the system, despite that, many showed him the correct path, the path to success. Without those people, Kaya thought, he wouldn't be the person he was now. He wouldn't be the leader, the man in charge of all of Japan.\\n\\nKaya's writing slowed down, his hand growing numb. He felt conflicted and saddened. Who to remove and who to keep? His body kept on writing but his brain was telling him to stop. He was wrestling with self-consciousness at this point. "Stop writing, scrap that list, and just keep them, they are your closest and only friends. If you replace the people you trust, you won't be safe anymore. Not there." His consciousness was correct, yet, he soldiered on and continued to write.\n\nThen Kaya realized that his memories of the past were clouding his mind and hampering his judgement. He realized that he was dwelling on the past, and not looking towards the future. In his mind, it clicked, and his writing quickened and paced, his fervor high. His goal was grand in scale, grand enough to overcome any bonds he'd made. His passion surged, as powerful as the tidal Great Wave. His determination grew higher than Mt. Fuji itself. What Kaya would remember that day, was that his purpose, to let the Rising Sun rise higher than it ever did, would be his number one priority, and that he'd let nothing prevent him from completing his quest.\n\nSeveral hours later, at dawn, Kaya had managed to finish writing the list. It was long and unorganized. While preparing to get ready for work, Kaya took one last look at the paper and as he stuffed it in the suitcase, Kaya shed one single tear and whispered softly:"

"This new project reached the ears of people like investors and engineers. Many held unanimous agreements in favor of it and many around the Sphere overjoyed as this new plan would lead to many more opportunities for not only the shareholders above, but perhaps even the workers below as well."\n\nUpon hearing this, Kaya's mouth curved upwards into that of a smirk. The final icing on the cake to this chain of events was Kaya discovered a single bottle of sake in his office pantry, which he felt would be a shame to not use.

Around 200 estimated personnel were lost and the rig was deemed unsalvageable.\\n\\nIncident No.2/Parang Bauxite Mine Truck Accident: To comply with a new quota for bauxite extraction, the threshold for amounts of bauxite loaded on the trucks was increased. In one such incident at 2:15 PM, as a truck was being loaded with bauxite extract, the weight of the Bauxite caused the truck to slip down the slope and was sent toppling down the bauxite sink. The truck spun and landed on its front end, instantly killing the driver and several miners in the vicinity. In addition, a larger dust cloud was generated and several hundred workers were found to have inhaled it, leading to more workers to be hospitalized and several more deaths recorded later that day. The total number of deceased is around 50-100 with as many as 300 noted with symptoms of dust inhalation.

 japkaya.162.d:0 "Today, an incident occurred at noon within the Java Rubber Plantation in which a large fire began from an unknown source, potentially a smoking incident within the plantation and spread rapidly, enveloping a large amount of the area and rapidly burnt down a large swath of trees. The nearby workers scrambled quickly to quell the raging inferno and were successful in putting it out a few hours later. The aftershocks of the catastrophe were reviewed, and economic advisors estimated that this wildfire burned about hundreds of yen worth of potential rubber exports and many irreplaceable rubber trees were lost in the blaze. Noted as well were potential casualties as the final tally count for the workers was around seventy-five, which was half of the original work force. The administration apologizes on behalf of the fire, saying they will investigate who was responsible and try to monitor the worker's activities more closely."

Several minutes after the explosion, several rescue teams were dispatched to try locating any survivors by listening for their calls for help. At 6:50 PM, the entrance to the tunnel was able to be cleared using machinery and the operators entered and searched for any possible miners still left alive. By 7:10 PM the operators found 154 miners out of 470 total working at that time. Many of the men surviving had varying degrees of injury, from scratches on their bodies, to near critical organ damage. A total of around 62 men were hospitalized and the rest were also administered and released the next morning. The company apologizes for the mishap and publicly states that monetary aid be given to the victims and their families."

At 2:12 PM, the crucible containing molten lava in the factory exploded, spilling the contents around the facility. The flammable equipment in the room caught fire and quickly spread around the area. By 2:20 PM, the entire section was engulfed in flames. At 2:25 PM, the first firefighters and aid workers arrived to put out the damage and rescue any workers trapped within the factory. A total of 126 workers were rescued from the total of 210 workers in the mill. Many suffered several-degree burns and some even had shrapnel from the crucible's explosion. An after investigation revealed that the conditions of the workplace were unsupervised and the equipment was faulty and cheaply produced. Showa apologizes for this and pledges to send out compensations for the families of the affected and will improve on the factory's conditions post-reconstruction."

If you did, we can get down to brass tacks."\n\nThe tone in the men's voices give off an air of affability, while the reality couldn't be further from the truth. Kishi was here for one purpose, and one purpose only - extract more and more favours from the weak-willed bureaucrat. Kishi has little interest in directly seizing power from Kaya - as much as he could easily do so, it would require too many contingencies and formalities. Laid out in front of him were several folders of audit sheets, contracts and ministerial directives, containing the details of his proposal to Kaya.\n\n"Kishi-san, this is too egregious isn't it? Rendering enterprises in the Home Islands toothless in the face of Manchurian production?"\n\n"Well, yes it would come at the expense of the corporation's profits - but remember who we're dealing with here, Kaya-san. We're dealing with a gaggle of incompetents, unfit to lead this nation's glorious economic rebirth. I trust you're familiar with me long enough to know that my requests aren't favours - they're demands."\n\nAnd so, Kaya went to stamping and signing the various contracts; Showa Steel, Nakajima, Kwantung Industries, Nissan Heavy Chemical Industries. Attached to the folders he would be handing over to Kishi were ministerial directives nominally his own, but were Kishi's private and personal orders.\n\n"You're doing well, Kaya-san. Prince Takeda would report to you regarding the productivity of these new investments in 3 months. Till then, I bid you farewell.""

Of note was a folder marked with the seal of the Judiciary - a folder containing the profiles of promising judges and judiciary bureaucrats. They were supposed to head directly to the Prime Minister, but upon the veiled threats of career suicide and exile through Kishi's goons, they ended up at his desk. Nothing personal, Kishi thought to himself - it's just business after all, before picking up one of the newspapers.\\n\\n"Justice Rules In Favour Of Student Leader in Peace Preservation Law Controversy".\n\nKishi lets out a little tut-tut before taking another sip from the glass of cognac. In his eyes, this was merely another failure of the justice system to uphold Kokutai. If they couldn't uphold the very fabric of the Japanese state, how would they even be reliable appendages for any further reforms to the Japanese state? Cutting his train of thought, he pulled out another folder of his own - a list of reliable, or pliable bureaucrats and judiciary officials from his days in Manchuria, and began to sort them out.\n\nNAKANO, FUMIO: ATTORNEY-GENERAL, SHINKYOU SPECIAL MUNICIPALITY (1947-1954)FUMIAKI, AKIRA: DEPUTY JUSTICE, SPECIAL SECURITY COURT (1956 - 1959)Kishi did not stop filing until the sun rose.

They don't have respect for us anymore; even some of the MPs talk down upon the empire. I think it's best if we taught them a lesson - we must show them that we are here to stay."\n\nKaya looked at Kishi with eyes rounded with awe. He knew his colleague was right; dissenters were far too comfortable in criticising the government, and they needed to know their place. What his sinister tone, however, indicated he was willing to go a step too far.\n\n"Kishi, you give a fair point, but we're not tyrants." the Prime Minister chuckled, glancing up at Kishi who was now staring him down with feverish, bloodshot eyes. Kaya took a deep breath and returned to his newspaper, hiding from the striking gaze of the wicked man.""

Kaya, who sat behind his desk, refused to cower in the face of such intimidation. Kishi spoke slowly, uttering each word with an intent to make his position clear to the Prime Minister.\n\n"Prime Minister... you and I both know the importance of funding the military appropriately. The army's budget has... constrained much of their operations and capability to defend the Sphere. We all ask you to... alleviate this issue. Now, will you be the man to pride the empire's military for its role in safeguarding the Pacific... or will you be the one sapping away it's ability to defend the women and children of this great nation?"\n\n"Mr. Kishi, we've played this game before - I will not be intimidated by you! Besides, we've already spent a long while calculating the perfect budget; the army doesn't need anything more. Throwing more at it will overburden the coffers-"\n\n"Mr. Prime Minister, I don't think you... understand. I could very well ask your colleagues who preside over the budget to resign. I am not asking if you can do it; I am asking if YOU want to do it."\n\nKishi's malevolent presence loomed over Kaya, irking the Prime Minister with a profound shock. He was under immense strain and now was visibly sweating, giving in to the intense pressures of the powerful and coercive politician.""
