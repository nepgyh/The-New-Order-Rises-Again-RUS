 RAJ_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The fall of the British Raj in 1944 to the forces of the Axis left a power vacuum to fill. In those desperate deciding moments, the INC declared a republic and clawed their way across India, until the gunfire ended. And then, shortly afterwards, chaos once again engulfed India, as Hyderabad fell to a socialist insurgency. Although the Indian government crushed the insurgency and annexed Hyderabad, the Telanganies continue to agitate against the government. Now India holds on by a thread, and while the smart leadership has ensured that the Republic stays, it won't last forever, with Prime Minister Nehru's health failing. the Azad Hind stands guard on the border, ready to crush Indian democracy at any moment shall crisis engulf India once again. the fate of the young Republic is yet to be decided, but we can only hope to the Gods that it is a positive one."

 ##Leader Descriptions##
 #######################

 POLITICS_JAWAHARLAL_NEHRU_DESC:0 "Родившийся в привилегированной семье, уже участвовавшей в борьбе за независимость, Джавахарлал Неру познакомился с Индией и ее традициями почти как посторонний - получив английское образование в самом сердце Британской империи и только затем вернувшись домой. Тем не менее, участие в борьбе Конгресса за независимость по правую руку от самого Махатмы принесло ему народную поддержку и руководящие посты - так что, когда британское владычество наконец бесславно рухнуло в 1943 году, он был рядом, чтобы взять бразды правления в свои руки.\n\nНо это лидерство было не только его собственным. Оказавшись между экспансионистским Афганистаном на западе, японской угрозой, вторгающейся с востока, и принцами борющимися за свою независимость, Неру предпочел вместо этого пойти на компромисс со своей властью ради нации, пригласив Субхаса Боса и Азад Хинд сформировать совместное правительство ради сохранения территориальной неприкосновенности Индии. Союз, который не продлился долго, и с учетом неудач в войне против Афганистана их можно было переложить на своего бывшего друга и союзника, а затем наблюдать, как он бежит на Восток, формируя непримиримое конкурирующее правительство в Калькутте.\n\nСейчас, управляя только половиной страны, Неру, тем не менее, стремился построить Индию в соответствии со своим видением и видением остальных членов Конгресса - суверенную, социалистическую, светскую и демократическую республику, свободную от авторитаризма, который преследовал другие постколониальные государства. В течение двух десятилетий он трудился на посту премьер-министра в этом начинании, но теперь, похоже, его время подходит к концу. Возможно, он не сможет уладить дела и увидеть объединенную Индию при своей жизни. Но его наследие - ради Индии - должно сохраниться."
 POLITICS_SA_DANGE_DESC:0 "Шрипад Амрит Данге прожил жизнь, полную работы. С момента своего рождения в 1899 году он служил силам коммунизма и Индии, занимая пост председателя Коммунистической партии Индии с 1951 года. Далекий от неортодоксальности, Данге искренне верит в линию, которую ранее продвигали Советский Союз и большевизм. Но откуда, собственно, он взялся?\n\nРанняя жизнь Данге была похожа на жизнь многих нынешних индийских политиков: они боролись за свободу индийского субконтинента от британских когтей. Однако, в то время как многие перешли к Ганди, Неру и Бозе, Данге вместо этого перешел к другой менее известной, но все еще популярной фигуре: Манабендре Натх Рою, основателю Коммунистической партии Мексики, Радикальной демократической партии и, что более важно для истории Данге, Коммунистической партии Индии. Однако, в то время как Рой был более умеренным и позже перешел от коммунизма к своему собственному так называемому "Radical Humanism", Dange continued to support Lenin's ways to no end.\n\nIn the 1950s, Dange supported the Telangana Rebellion against the Nizam of Hyderabad, and found a friend in its leader: Chandra Rajeswara Rao. Alongside Rao, Dange began to bring the CPI from Roy's old ways to a stable, Leninist structure that would be able to compete with Congress on a national scale. With Dange being a home name and Rao a more libertarian figurehead as well as a war hero, the CPI began to catch up in elections at a breakneck pace. But it was still not enough to win. That is, until the 1960s. Gaining even more strength from the collapse of Congress into several squabbling parties, Dange made his move - and won. With a CPI majority in the Lok Sabha, however, many conservatives have already begun to riot, and it remains to be seen if Dange can keep India together, or if it shall tear apart."
 POLITICS_MORARJI_DESAI_DESC:0 "Мораджи Десаи - человек, всю свою жизнь находившийся в тени Конгресса и других политиков. Вместе со своими сверстниками он сражался во время борьбы за свободу бок о бок с Ганди, а также занимал высшие посты в администрации Бомбея во время выборов 1937 года.\n\nОднако резкое возвышение Неру, Боса и других социалистических деятелей после распада британской колонии, оставило в стороне консервативных сторонников ИНК. И тем не менее, Десаи твёрдо стоял на своем, становясь всё более популярным в Конгрессе на фоне установления нового порядка в Индии. А после провала ошибочной конференции Менона, который пытался достучаться до безумцев на Востоке, Десаи, наконец, пришёл к власти в стране.\n\nНовый премьер не придерживается идеологии, приведшей Россию к краху. Вместо этого он оборачивается к всё это время процветавшему капитализму. Десаи также не придерживается глупой идеи нейтралитета в то время, как война неизбежна. Путь вперёд очевиден, и Мораджи бесстрашно по нему пойдёт."
 POLITICS_INDIRA_GANDHI_DESC:0 "Родившаяся в 1917 году дочь самого Джавахарлала Неру, Индира Ганди с детства была тесно связана с миром политики. Хотя в юности она страдала от одиночества, Ганди преуспела как в учёбе, так и в общественной жизни, активно участвуя в движении за независимость во время Второй мировой войны. Её муж, Фероз Ганди, стал видной фигурой в Индийском национальном конгрессе, а её амбиции вскоре превратились в прагматичное принятие своей роли - она стала личным секретарём своего отца.\n\nСопровождая отца в многочисленных международных поездках, Индира способствовала установлению дипломатических связей Индии по всему миру. К концу 1950-х годов Ганди заняла пост президента Конгресса, а после смерти отца вошла в Раджья Сабху. Многие рассматривали её как естественного преемника Джавахарлала Неру. Однако и эта остановка в её карьерном пути оказалась недолгой - вскоре Ганди стала преемницей Менона, когда тот отошёл от дел.\n\nТеперь Индира стоит на вершине государства, будучи первым лидером союза, скреплённого дипломатией. Раньше никто не возлагал на неё больших надежд, видя в ней лишь "
 POLITICS_CHAKRAVARTI_RAJAGOPALACHARI_DESC:0 "Чакраварти Раджагопалачари, или просто Раджаджи, - это человек, который перестал быть серым кардиналом политики Индии, чтобы занять в ней центральное место, совершив такую рокировку невероятно драматическим способом.\n\nРодившийся болезненным ребенком в Мадрасе в 1878 году, всего через двадцать один год после первой войны за независимость, Раджаджи участвовал в движении за независимость с самого его зарождения. Начиная с 1906 года и заканчивая крушением колониального порядка, он приложил руку почти к каждому действию по ослаблению британской власти в Индии. В хаотичные дни, последовавшие за созданием правительства национального единства, Раджаджи воздержался от вступления на какую бы то ни было должность - только для того, чтобы затем появиться в составе чрезвычайного кабинета Неру после окончания войны с Афганистаном. Вскоре после этого он снова ушёл из ИНК, неуклонно продвигая свою классически либеральную альтернативу. И теперь, когда его долгая-предолгая жизнь близится к концу, ему удалось, по крайней мере, совершить невозможное и свергнуть Индийский национальный конгресс."
 POLITICS_SAVITRI_DEVI_DESC:0 "From the darkness of the world shone forth a light. For aeons it had illuminated the dark and issued embers from the heavens to cleanse the world below of its foulest sins. But the light grew dimmer with the passing of time, weakened by the very rot it was born to destroy... until one man stepped forth to bear its torch at the dying throes of mankind. He welded the life-giving light like a mighty weapon, smiting his foes for the greater good. His name was Adolf Hitler, wielder of lightning and sun, the avatar of Vishnu - and only Satrivi Devi knew this holy truth.\n\nSavitri Devi was neither born in India, nor was she born of its bloodline. She was born Maximine Portas in France to a Greek father, and when she came of age she considered herself an ardent Greek nationalist. However, her enlightenment was yet to come. She found her true calling not in Europe, but in the true homeland of the Aryans: India. Portas became enthralled by Indian culture and converted to Hinduism, taking an Indian name: Savitri Devi, Sanskrit for Sun-rays Goddess. Devi dedicated her life to saving the Aryans of India, aiding the Axis during the Second World War, being the one who enabled Subhas Chandra Bose to make contact with Japan. She served Free India for years after the war, but was eventually kicked out alongside her husband after "evidence" was presented showing that they had plotted against the country, even resorting to plans of terrorism. On the other side, Devi remained determined, and she began preparing her ascent once more so that the Aryan people could be saved.\n\nNow, Devi's plans have finally come to pass. He who was brought to this Earth to save mankind lives no more, but his sacrifice endures, and Devi will take up the torch, and scorch the planet until it is pure, tainted no longer. Devi will end the Kali Yuga. Devi shall be the lightning and the sun."

 RAJ_religious_tension:0 "Religious Tension"
 RAJ_religious_tension_desc:0 "India's religious makeup is countlessly varied, with Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, and even more tiny religious groups, such as Jews and Zoroastrians. These religious groups are hardly on the best of terms, and interfaith violence is rampant, with the All-India Muslim League constantly coming at odds with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, and the other faiths often fighting against the more major ones, as well as between each other.\n\nEither extensive autonomy or independence for at least some of these groups is inevitable, and if such changes are not brought about by the Indian government, then they will be pursued by violent means."
 RAJ_Permit_Raj:0 "The Permit Raj"
 RAJ_Permit_Raj_desc:0 "While the Azad Hind abolished private business as a whole, the Republic has kept it around, albeit with a byzantine bureaucratic system of regulations and red tape. This system is the product of Jawaharlal Nehru in an attempt to create a command economy, working alongside the Five-Year Plans and other economic laws and principles.\n\nThe system of bureaucracy, known popularly as the "Permit Raj" in a mocking comparison to British rule, is extremely corrupt and severely stunts economic growth, as well. It creates a heavy division between the left wing of Congress, believing it is necessary and good to keep socialism around, and the right wing, finding it a needless system run by incompetents."
 RAJ_disunited_government:0 "Disunited Government"
 RAJ_disunited_government_desc:0 "The Indian National Congress is a big-tent political party ranging from communism to borderline fascism, and everything in between. Unfortunately, this large-reaching coaltiion has led to many issues within our government, with conservatives constantly feuding with leftists and anarchists feuding with centralists.\n\nSo far, only one charismatic leader has managed to maintain the coalition; the father of the nation, Jawaharlal Nehru. However, the father's days are numbered, and when he inevitably passes, it is doubtful that a leader as charismatic as him will fill the vacuum, and chaos will ensue."

 RAJ_icwfamine1:0 "Rumours Of Famine"
 RAJ_icwfamine1_desc:0 "All across the land, worrying reports are trickling in. Reports of near empty granaries, bare fields, disrupted food imports and more seem to indicate that a true famine is almost upon us. Worse, after the famine hoax of 1962, many people are simply refusing to heed the warnings, believing it to be yet another attempt to humiliate India. At this critical moment of conflict, a famine would be truly devastating. A solution must be found, or an end must be brought to the conflict, or else the situation could become quite dire indeed."
 RAJ_icwfamine2:0 "Famine"
 RAJ_icwfamine2_desc:0 "The worst has happened. Critical food shortages are rampant in nearly every city and worse in the countryside, and people are feeling the impact. Even those who believed it to be just another hoax can no longer deny what is happening. With the population growing hungrier by the day, every layer and pillar of society is adversely affected, severely hampering the war effort. An army marches on its stomach, and it is said that all civilized societies are just three missed meals away from anarchy.\n\nHandling this situation will be critical to the continued survival of the nation's forces, but care must be taken to balance relief efforts with efforts to bring this conflict to a conclusion - there is no use in people filling their bellies if they are merely fattening themselves for slaughter."
 RAJ_icwfamine3:0 "Indian Anarchy - Stage One"
 RAJ_icwfamine3_desc:0 "India weeps. With the civil war continuing to rage on, the industries and institutions that once sustained the subcontinent have all but sputtered out. Famine and disease are spreading rapidly, and the people of all the warring factions are growing increasingly furious and terrified. We have enough supply and rations to stave off true chaos for the time being, but should this war not be brought to a conclusion soon, things are only going to get worse.\n\n§RFor the sake of India, there must be a swift end to this madness.§!"
 RAJ_icwfamine4:0 "Indian Anarchy - Stage Two"
 RAJ_icwfamine4_desc:0 "India bleeds. Social order beyond the military chain of command has almost completely broken down. Starvation and illness are near universal, displacement is widespread, and practically every city in the nation lies in various states of ruin. This civil war has become the deadliest conflict to ever blight the subcontinent, but even worse horrors will surely follow if victory is not achieved soon. the men of India no longer fight for ideology, but for the very soul of India itself.\n\n§RThe insanity grows further. India hangs over an abyss.§!"
 RAJ_icwfamine5:0 "Indian Anarchy - Stage Three"
 RAJ_icwfamine5_desc:0 "India burns. the rivers sit clogged with corpses, the fields lie burned and bare, the once busy streets of the markets echo with the wind and dust. Mothers weep for their sons, daughters weep for their mothers; every family knows the pain of loss. Those who still fight at all do so out of a pure and desperate drive to survive, and looting and pillaging of whatever holdouts of prosperity that still exist has become a daily occurence. Nobody knows if victory is possible at this point - even if it is, it is uncertain if India will ever rise from the ashes again.\n\n§RKali walks the earth, and Armageddon follows in his wake.§!"

 RAJ_intensified_production:0 "Intensified Production"
 RAJ_intensified_production_desc:0 "Determined to see the faction to victory, workers, farmers and laborers together are performing their work with renewed vigor. Guns aplenty stream from makeshift workshops, fortifications are dug in record time, and supplies are consistently delivered to schedule with added surplus. Everyone who can lend a hand does so where they can, and in all, industry is running like a well-oiled, overclocked machine. It is unlikely this breakneck pace can be kept up forever, of course, but for the time being the sky-high production rates are a welcome boon to the war effort."
 ICW_jai_hind:0 "Vande Mataram!"
 ICW_jai_hind_desc:0 ""Who hath said thou art weak in thy lands\nWhen the swords flash out in seventy million hands\nAnd seventy million voices roar\nThy dreadful name from shore to shore?\nWith many strengths who art mighty and stored,\nTo thee I call Mother and Lord!"\n\nInvoking the spirit of Indian independence and the shared loyalty of the people to the Indian motherland, both the common folk and the armed forces maintain a fierce determination to see the conflict through to the end, believing their cause to be righteous in the preservation and restoration of the glory of the Indian nation."
 ICW_fash_jai_hind:0 ""Our Faith" Radio Speech"
 ICW_fash_jai_hind_desc:0 ""Hinduism is the common soul of India! It is not merely the connection of the people to the divine, it forms the very fabric of Indian society. To have India without the light of the faith is to have a body without form, a mind without will, a nation without a purpose. It is the very essence of what it means to be Indian, and we will not rest until the atheists and the worshipers of false gods are swept aside and prevented from ever sullying our divine heritage ever again!"\n\nThe forces of the Janata Front fight for Hindutva, and the firm belief that Hinduism and the Indian national identity are one and the same. In this belief, their resolve and determination are impressive - their treatment of those who reject this belief is... less so. Still, even their enemies must admit that their martial ferocity and zeal make them more than worthy foes."
 ICW_commie_jai_hind:0 ""Nothing To Lose" Radio Speech"
 ICW_commie_jai_hind_desc:0 ""the world today is awash in the shadow of fascism. the 'great' powers of Europe and Asia have been enveloped by its embrace, and the spirit of their people broken. But a light still exists in India, a light that lives in us today! the treacherous INC may have tried to snuff it out as the fascists have across the world, but we are the workers of India! Our struggle is not just for the freedom of ourselves, but to keep the light burning, that the peoples of this world may still believe - believe in Marxism, believe that revolution is still possible! So for the nation, for the world, march forwards workers of India, for you have nothing to lose but your chains!"\n\nThe revolutionaries of India know that raising the red banner in a world under the fasces is a dangerous proposition, and they are all the more impetuous for it. After all, some would say that when the struggle seems most impossible, there is nothing left to lose. Their struggle is to see India freed from the twin demons of fascism and capitalism, and whether they win or die, freedom shall be attained."

However, in order for us to achieve victory over our enemies, all citizens must do their part to aid the war effort. Thus, we have encouraged all citizens who are not actively fighting in the war to do their part by engaging in whatever production they can. No matter how small-scale it is, we need every last bit!"
 ICW_indira_is_here:0 "Indira Gandhi's Presence"
 ICW_indira_is_here_desc:0 "It is no secret that our democracy is in a great deal of trouble. With threats to our republic from both left and right, we are certainly in a very precarious situation.\n\nHowever, there is some good news. India Gandhi, the daughter of the late, great Jawaharlal Nehru, as well as popular politician in her own right , has voiced her support for the ideals of a democratic, republican India. This is a great boon to us and will give us additional support and stability."
 RAJ_unpopular_rebellion:0 "Low Hindutva Popularity"
 RAJ_unpopular_rebellion_desc:0 "For whatever reason, the general populace does not seem to support our righteous crusade in the name of Hindutva, believing it to be "too radical". What's worse, our conscription measures are widely hated by the people we draft into our valiant struggle for India's salvation, which makes us even more unpopular. This is not good, and will undoubtedly not bode well for our cause..."
 RAJ_no_more_tyranny:0 "No More Tyranny!"
 RAJ_no_more_tyranny_desc:0 "The revolution has begun! All across India, the peasants, the poor, and the downtrodden are rising up against their exploitative oppressors. Capitalists and landlords across the subcontinent are quaking in their boots as the people have begun to organize against them. As they should, of course! We are coming for them! Their days of exploiting the people of India are over!"
 RAJ_for_freedom_and_democracy:0 "For Freedom and Democracy!"
 RAJ_for_freedom_and_democracy_desc:0 "The people of India deserve better.

We shall defend democracy and freedom to our very last! We shall defeat both the communists and the fascists, and preserve our republic!"

 india.7777.a:0 "Joy Rao!"
 india.7777.desc:0 ""There was once a time that many among us willingly starved themselves in the name of independence. Now, the gods laugh at us as we are starved by our own freedom. Tiny children cry as they watch their families' fields burn, for even they know that those meagre and sick crops were the last of what they had. Those that are not ash at the hands of the demons are picked clean, looters and starving people having combed every inch for every grain, every seed. Boys and girls with their ribs bursting through their stomachs try to eat unhusked wheat straight from the stalk, their mothers sobbing as they try to move further, their muscles too weak to carry on.\n\nIt is no longer safe to walk alone from village to village. It is not just the guerillas and the partisans that will harass us now. People who travel by themselves go missing, taken by others who have run out of options. Men have become monsters, striking in the night and devouring their own brethren. This is no longer a war between factions and ideologies, it is a war where every man is his own nation, army, and creed, and every single one must fight for himself or die.\n\nThere will never be victory. This war has been lost by all, and we will never, ever recover. A better India is now but a stillborn dream. This is a hell upon the Earth, and we have brought it upon ourselves. We were too occupied with lies of a better future, with deceptions of a better tomorrow. Is the beauty of the whole really enhanced by our agony? And is the whole really beautiful? I no longer know, nor does it matter. We only want to be safe and well-fed once more.\n\nPeople of Orissa, I know more than any other how we have suffered. I know that so many have already asked you to fight. It truly pains me but I must ask you to fight one last time. I ask you not to fight for me, nor for my ideology. I only ask that you fight alongside me for our survival and so that perhaps we can be safe again, one day.""

 india.1.t:0 "Mass Protests"
 india.1.desc:0 "The election of the CPI was clearly very divisive for our nation. While many have praised the CPI as a new step forwards for India towards its constitutional goal of socialism, many others have accused them of voter fraud and American involvement in rigging the elections towards their favour.\n\nToday, a large protest has begun in Delhi, composed mostly of Hindu nationalists, but also consisting of conservatives. These protesters demand a recount of elections, as well as an answer to the question of American interference. Of course, these foolish demands by our opposition shall not fall on deaf ears: rather, they shall learn of the peaceful ways of socialism - by force!"
 india.1.a:0 "Let's see how a protestor stands up to a tank!"
 
 india.22.t:0 "The Kingdom of Nepal"
 india.22.desc:0 "The Kingdom of Nepal is a small mountain nation in the Himalayas. Situated between us, Tibet, and the Azad Hind, Nepal has been locked in a bitter influence war between us. This war of influence is symbolised by occasional expelling of advisors in Nepal and even embassies, at least temporarily. This conflict, being a key part of the struggle in India, will likely last until either Indian reunification or until something goes wrong with Nepal. As such, we will probably be in Nepal for a while to come."
 india.22.a:0 "Interesting."
 
 india.23.t:0 "Total Independence Day"
 india.23.desc:0 "On this day, January 26th, the people of India celebrate Poorna Swaraj Day, or Total Independence Day. Declared by our forefathers a generation ago, before we even achieved freedom, it is difficult for many young Indians to believe that we were once under the British thumb. Now, over two decades later, we stand embroiled in a conflict between two titans who once fought together.\n\nAs time passes, the Indian conflict has evolved from a national struggle to that of not an ideological struggle or a political struggle, but a power struggle. While those who were first to betray the ideals of Gandhi and trade one devil for another stand on the other side of the Ganges, we have not allowed the ideals of freedom, peace, and democracy part from our nation. And, when the years of suffering descend upon us once more, Delhi shall be the sole seat of the Indian government."

 demindia.1.t:0 "The New India"
 demindia.1.desc:0 "The formation of the Republic of India was not, as expected, a process of slow reform and eventually victory over the English imperialists. Instead, it was a Governor-General running scared when the Raj was invaded by Afghanistan and Japan, followed by the seizure of power by the INC, and a brutal reclamation of many of India's territories by the republic until a ceasefire was declared. Now, for the first time in ages, India was free from British rule. But now, Afghanistan owned a chunk of Indian land, and Japan was operating a puppet state out of Bengal.\n\nIf that wasn't bad enough, communist uprisings coincided with fascist insurgencies in the turbulent year that was 1947. Osman Ali Khan's lack of action was India's cue to defeat the rebellions and abolish the princely states, reforming into the republic it was meant to be.\n\nNow the Republic fights on to preserve itself. Nehru's health is failing, and the CPI, the RSS, and even more sides are looking to fill the gap. Shall the Republic revail? Will India be born anew under a new cause and flag? Or shall it fall to the forces of darkness?"
 demindia.1.a:0 "Vande Mataram!"

 demindia.2.t:0 "Communist-Aligned Union Agitation"
 demindia.2.desc:0 "Despite the ongoing efforts by the government of Jawaharlal Nehru and the INC to provide the best conditions for the indian workers union groups connected to the Communist Party of India have taken the decision to engage in union action across the nation's cities. With the CPI seemingly uncooperative at this moment there looks to be no clear path to a peaceful resolution of this emergent situation and the government is left with few options to resolve this near complete shutdown of the nation's industry.\n\nAs such it is necessary for the Dehli administration to formulate a response to the communists and whilst using the apparatus of state to crack down on these groups would hardly endear our government in the eyes of the CPI; to leave the nation in the grasp of union agitation would hardly be responsible given our already sluggish economic state."
 demindia.2.a:0 "Let the strike run its course."
 demindia.2.b:0 "Crack down on the agitators."

 demindia.3.t:0 "Eruption of Communal Violence"
 demindia.3.desc:0 "Continued tensions with the Islamic population in our republic have spilled over in recent days as fire illuminates the breaking dawn. Calling the government's continued neglect of muslim issues to be a disgrace and direct attack on the wellbeing of the community; violence has broken out with angered mobs engaging in communally based savagery.\n\nWith blatant support for this rioting coming from the japanese lapdogs in Bengal who have called the events a clear inditement against our government's policies and with the Muslim League refusing to issue any form of denouncement against the rioters until Dehli makes concessions India is engulfed in violence not seen since the dissolution of the raj and the chaos that ensued.\n\nAs the nation buckles with the strain there is increasing pressure from state actors within the halls of power and organisations without to make promises to implement long needed reforms regarding the muslim issue in the nation. On the other hand members of the cabinet have expressed their concerns regarding the problem and believe that making such promises would merely play into Calcutta's hands and further inflame sectarian sentiments."
 demindia.3.a:0 "Promise something! Anything!"

 demindia.4.t:0 "Nehru Proposes New Compromises"
 demindia.4.desc:0 "Despite the best efforts of the government, the previous two decades haven't improved the situation India stands in much. While we have asserted ourselves as an important asset in the global stage, we are still plagued by intense problems here at home, from the rampant illiteracy that is causing us to lag behind technologically to the homelessness that permeates all corners of India and slows down the economy. All groups agree that those must be fixed, but not many agree on the solution itself.\n\nTo remedy this, the Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, has come forth with a few proposals to better deal with the situation and unite the country. Being a democratic socialist himself, this has surprised a few of the party members, but nevertheless Nehru was heard out in the government. He proposed to personally meet with the leaders of important political groups in the country and broker reforms that would please all of them at the same time."
 demindia.4.a:0 "That sounds nice!"

 demindia.5.t:0 "Clashes in Sri Lanka"
 demindia.5.desc:0 "In the chaos of independence the fate of British Ceylon was precarious. Administrated separately from the Raj, the collapse of the British Empire and the chaos of the War of Independence placed the island on a knife's edge, with the road to Colombo seemingly open to the INA.\n\nIn the midst of this situation, the island was less than peacefully seized by pro-Delhi forces, aided by the island's Sinhalese population in the south. What little calm existed in Sri Lanka was short-lived, and, in recent days, ethnic tensions between the island's majority Sinhalese population and Tamil minority have flared up yet again.\n\nWith Tamil community figures denouncing our administration for what it sees as neglect and a policy no different from the British towards the island, violence has been sparked following months of agitation. With the north of the island hardest hit, security forces loyal to our administration are hard at work to prevent further escalation; however, with local officials seemingly more interested in aiding their own communities, it is a hard struggle for Delhi to restore order.\n\nAs such, some cabinet members, on the advice of local leaders on the island have called for Nehru's government to grant greater autonomy and abolish the "Sinhala Only Act", so as to hopefully ease the Tamil fears of segregation in the region; although what such action would mean for minority groups in Sri Lanka is less clear, and not as optimistic."
 demindia.5.a:0 "Things are going to get better!"

 demindia.6.t:0 "Sikh Agitation"
 demindia.6.desc:0 "Attacking government policy from Delhi, Sikh groups have marched in protest in Lahore, calling for the government to provide proper attention to the issues regarding the Sikh community.\n\nCalling the current administration's actions over the decades since independence to be neglectful and disadvantageous to the Sikh community, these groups have used the protests to denounce our government and call for legal reforms to, in their opinion, properly address the situation.\n\nThese events are creating yet more pressure on the administration in Delhi, and, if not dealt with in a prompt and measured manner, could bring yet further religious tensions to the subcontinent and our fair republic. Whilst the government could take the decision to promise reforms in the future to address the concerns being raised by these groups, some within the cabinet have called on Nehru to deny such pressures and maintain silent on the issue of any further reforms regarding the Sikh community until a future date."
 demindia.6.a:0 "Calm down, it's going to be fine!"

 demindia.7.desc:0 "In a recent statement, Feroz Khan Noon, leader of the AIML, called for the people of his faith to fight for their freedom. Speaking on the radio to thousands, Khan said that negotiations were proving to be unproductive, and that if the dream of an independent Pakistan was ever to be achieved, they had to push harder. No more cooperation; if the demands aren't met, the people of Pakistan should never budge and even take up arms if they must.\n\nKhan's voice is not one without weight. He is a primary figure in the Indian Muslim community, which is very large and has much influence in the greater Islamic sphere of the subcontinent. His calls for a free Pakistan could rouse many who were nervous to act. While some have put forth the belief that Khan was funded by the Azad Hind, many have rejected this as untrue, and to many, it wouldn't even matter; Khan's call rings true to their struggle.\n\nUnfortunately, but unsurprisingly, Khan's rallying cry has only made the situation worse. There is now greater cooperation between Muslim groups on both sides of the border, and a figure as big as Khan speaking out has caused thousands to join the movement. Fewer and fewer among these communities are willing to compromise, saying that there will be a free Pakistan whether it comes through negotiation or through uprising. If something isn't done to make them see differently, tensions could boil over. That cannot be allowed to happen."

With Hindu nationalist leaders denouncing the INC with renewed vigour for our failure to prevent these subversives from undermining the state, and even intensifying their calls for the replacement of the INC with an administration that will truly serve the Hindi people.\n\nWith the activities of the RSS and affiliated Hindu nationalist groups intensifying across the nation, and the power of the movement increasingly undermining the secular institutions of state under the INC, there have been calls from veteran politicians within the government to take action to prevent these marches and the inevitable Communal violence these groups will bring upon our heads in this increasingly tense society."

 demindia.9.desc:0 "The conference opened today with an opening address from Golwalkar, thanking everyone for coming and congratulating the soldiers who helped make the victory in the civil war possible. He then began listing off the challenges of the new government. Economic development, military development, education reform, establishing the new government's authority, and of course, renewing the nation's interest in spirituality. In order to do this, the Sarsangchalak recommended charting a more radical course than before.\n\nIn order to do this, for starters, the country would need to be less reliant on industry and embrace subsistence farming. Along with this, the army would need to be fully indoctrinated with the values of Hindutva, and political officers would be appointed to all military units to ensure loyalty to the leader.\n\nBut most worryingly, Golwalkar has argued that even within the party, enemy elements lay in wait, ready to strike at any moment. In order to preserve the nation, he argued, there would need to be a massive campaign against corruption and indignity, and that would affect even the highest ranking party members. This has worried both the RSS and the BJS, as his policies would conflict with both sides, thus possibly weaking both. Whether the congress will support the Sarsangchalak in his declarations, or unite against his ambitions, is yet to be decided, and whatever is chosen will surely change India's future."

Some have even suggested a vote of no confidence against Nehru, which has certainly made things worse.\n\nNehru has said that the reforms are necessary for the preservation of the republic. Sure, not everyone will like it, but better that than risking the collapse of everything they've worked for. Indira Gandhi has made numerous statements saying that order can only be preserved through unity within the INC, and that the party needs to stay united. Desai, the leader of the conservative faction, has said that the INC is too divided to effectively govern, and is arguing for conservatives like him to quit and form their own party to challenge the left-wing government.\n\nWhoever gets their way, this will be interesting."

Such has been the case for the past 18 years, and even earlier.\n\nBeing completely segregated from upper castes is a daily part of life for Dalit, from birth until death. Every day, an average of two Dalit are raped, three murdered, and two Dalit homes are set aflame. For other Indians, the Dalit are lower than human beings, and, despite our attempts to educate them away from such ideals, the cycle of violence continues.

 demindia.17.t:0 "Religious Freedom Act Draws Criticism"
 demindia.17.desc:0 "India's new religious act, while praised as a shining example of the nation's freedom and secular values, has also caught much criticism from the faithful of the nation. Radicals claim that it represents degeneracy, a rot in the country that will end with all spirituality being lost from the subcontinent, leaving only a husk. These crazed voices have many a follower, and as much as it pains the government they have to be taken seriously lest they bring even more people to their side.\n\nOn the one hand, M. S. Golwalkar, more commonly known as Guruji, has spoken up claiming that the act is meant to crush Hinduism and make way for islamists and seculars to cement control over the corrupt government. He has even claimed that the act asks for discrimination against Hindus, a lie that could be debunked by a three-year-old who had only skimmed the bill. His followers are still eating it up, and as with any time the government tries to implement some kind of religious freedom they now protest and call for India to adopt Hinduism as a state religion and do away with both degenerate atheism and the false faiths that supposedly "consume India from within".\n\nThat isn't even the end of it. the All-India Muslim League, a group that one might think would show great support for this kind of act, has instead chosen to also go on public record opposing it. Its members have a wide variety of reasons for disliking it: some claim that it is a token measure with no real power to try and pacify the Islamic community, while the most radical among them basically parrot Golwalkar's criticisms with "Islam" and "Hinduism" switched. the fact that such an obviously non-partisan and unifying bill is drawing so much criticism shows the danger that radicals pose to a liberal and democratic society."

 demindia.18.t:0 "Radicals Oppose Welfare Act"
 demindia.18.desc:0 "As always seems to happen, a new bill that one would think would appease radicals has instead brought opposition from both far ends of the political spectrum. Shirpad Amrit Dange, an ardent communist, and M. S. Golwalkar, India's most prominent fascist, have both come out in opposition to the new welfare act, and their gangs of ideological zealots have quickly joined in.\n\nDange and his communists belted out the same tired tirade that every socialist criticizing a social democratic government has said before. As always, instead of seeing this welfare act as a step towards their goals and a win for the common people of India, they have decided to view it as a method of distraction, a tiny token to appease the working man while the rich continue to exploit the people of the nation. No matter how the government tries to cooperate with them or appease them, it seems they simply will not rest until the democratic government has been overthrown, the current system ripped to shreds, and the communists are in full control.\n\nOn the other hand, we have the fascists under M.S. Golwalkar. While it was a long shot, there was still some hope that they would put aside their fanaticism for a moment to support this act, as many fascists in the RSS and BJS do in fact support a welfare system to serve the common people of India. Those hopes were quickly dashed when Golwalkar publicly called the act "communist infiltration of the government" despite the fact that the communists also opposed it. With Golwalkar against it, all his followers came out against it as well, dashing the government's hope of working with the radicals."

 demindia.19.desc:0 "The government's efforts to make life better for all citizens have never been without criticism, but recently some of its more "out there" opponents have taken a stand. the followers of Chandra Rajeswara Rao, more commonly known as the Raoists, have criticized practically all of our recent efforts, from welfare to religious freedom to healthcare, for the ridiculous idea that they are all meant to crush the laborers in the countryside. They say that the elites of India wish for the nation to be as urbanized as possible so that wealthy tyrants can best exploit the labor of the common worker.\n\nThese outlandish claims are unfortunately nothing new. Rao and his goons have for years now openly fought against anything resembling "urbanization", which to them is more of a bogeyman to accuse foes of supporting than any actual economic theory or idea. In broad terms, they support a socialist agrarian India, as the rural farming life is the best life for the Indian worker in their eyes. They want to keep people in the rural farms and stop the cities from growing any larger, as in their eyes cities are practically nothing but centers for the rich to more easily and efficiently exploit the work of everyday laborers.\n\nThis recent wave of criticism, while founded on basically nothing, has still managed to rally the Raoists and even bring new supporters to their side. Despite the obvious fact that our support systems are designed to help rural farmers just as much as urban Indians, there is an undeniable appeal to the cause of Rao when you are a poor farmer watching the cities become the center of the nation, leaving you behind. All we can hope to do is bring these agrarians around with kindness."

While the start showed some degree of promise, it seems that neither party is willing to come to any sort of agreement over how they'll move forward together.\n\nThe anti-communist elements within the INC swiftly dominated the conversation as soon as they saw any potential for compromise with the leftists. Fearing that they might be pushed out of the INC and that the party itself might eventually be taken as a mere puppet for the communists, they wholeheartedly committed to a stonewall defense against both the CPI and moderates within their own party. To a similar end, those puritanical and sectarian members of the Communist Party hijacked the representation and shut down any chance at a deal to ensure that the party would not be compromised by bourgeois morals and complacency.\n\nThough no one is entirely sure where the INC plans to go from here, having been rebuked by one of the major Indian parties, many are sure that the INC will struggle in the times to come without the unity they could've found in the communists."

Both sides at the start had quickly and harshly put their foot down on what they wanted with neither side giving any manner of leeway to the other. As the conversation went on the calm words of politicians grew to the shouts and yells of angry and stubborn men, incapable of compromise and unbending in their will. the entire event itself came to a head when Shripad Dange, leader of the CPI, stormed out of the room, taking the entirety of his delegation with him.\n\nIt seems as though the INC has made a new enemy, and that their failure to negotiate will lead to nothing but darker days for India."

Among the more unusual of these figures, one in particular stood out. Chandra Rajeswara Rao, head of a communist faction known as the Agrarianists. Named after the Telangana rebellion, in which the peasants of the region revolted against their feudal rulers. Rao himself was a leader in these revolts and developed many of his unorthodox theories from those years. Rao was born to an affluent peasant family, and went to university where he studied medicine.\n\nHis ideology is based around the idea of the true socialist utopian state being an almost entirely agricultural one, free from bourgeois concepts like urbanization or industrialisation. Rao is a firm believer that India, as an agricultural state, has no business being gentrified in such a western manner. In his mind, India requires socialism that is tailored to its nature. There will be no great industrial leap in Rao's India, but a leap towards agriculture and decentralisation. While his ideal end result will be that of a nation with small production centres for each village (with large towns and cities having been phased out), Rao is adamant that a strong authority most oversee this great upheaval so that it can be executed in the most efficient manner. He of course claims that such an authority would be dissolved in the end, but his critics are not convinced. Nor are they convinced about much anything he says."

With the All-India Muslim League rioting constantly, and tensions reaching a boiling point, many want us to do something. But what? A variety of proposals have come to our desk, each presented by high-ranking officials. the three most notable are as follows:\n\nThe first is proposed by Barkatullah Khan, Chief Minister of Rajasthan. It proposes total independence of Pakistan via negotiations between the Muslim League and the government to create lasting peace in the region. While this would be bad for our territorial matters, it would mean a quick end to the Muslim problem and a potential friendly ally in the region. the second is proposed by Chief of Muslim Affairs, Rajeshwar Dayal. It proposes an Islamic Autonomous Region, comprised of the areas claimed by the Pakistan movement that we currently control. This would allow us to keep both our land and keep the nationalists quiet, at least for the time being, but could give them a taste of greater freedom and cause even more cries for independence. the third, proposed by Deendayal Upadhyaya, leader of the BJS, is far more radical. It calls for integration of not just the Indian Muslims, but of all minorities into India, stripping away their autonomous status and making Hindi-language education mandatory, rather than Urdu, Punjabi, Sinhala, and so on. This has almost no benefits, but would keep the RSS quiet, at least for now.\n\nSo, what's the ultimate decision to end the Muslim issue, once and for all?"

Possibly they knew by some method lost to time, passed down from father to son. Regardless of how they reached their conclusion rumours would often spread in the days leading up to the harvest season. Whether they be bad or good, these stories would spread from the countryside into the cities where they would become even more exaggerated and widespread. This year, the rumours spoke famine. That barely any crops were going to grow properly and that everyone was going to suffer from it, no matter who they were, or where they lived. Rumours were rumours though, and despite the bad news they contained most people knew to ignore them. These stories would spring up rapidly and then disappear just as fast. This time, the rumours persisted for just a bit longer. Not much longer, just long enough to unsettle the usual skeptics.

This year, there weren't enough grapes to make up the expenses of the year, such as taxes, bills, and even the cost of the grapes themselves. the only people that Rajiv could afford to feed were his family, and even then, it was only the grapes that he grew.\n\nTo make matters worse, Rajiv is not alone.

I called the police, and when they came, it was a bomb. Someone must've known I was on the chase. That night, I looked through the tickets, and saw a name that I couldn't recall, although it seemed familiar. Jagadish Rao. the general secretary? No, that was Chandra Rajeswara Rao.

I searched up and down the streets, knocking at every door. But none of them knew anything.\n\nI was about to give up when I found them. Prakash and Sridevi Rao, parents of Jagadish Rao.

They waited on benches, reading from books and newspapers and chatting with others about the weather and current events. A few children ran around, hiding behind little things and jumping around, laughing as they whipped past their tired but happy parents.\n\nOne man was reading an old English book. He looked down at his watch, one of the most expensive things he owned. It had been given to him by his father when he became an adult, making it priceless by every definition. the man realized that the train was running slightly late. Irritating, but in truth it didn't bother him that much at all. He had plenty of time. A few minutes wouldn't change anything. He only hoped that the others here could all get where they needed to be. As he looked at his watch, he noticed an unattended briefcase sitting by itself. He squinted for a moment. Someone had probably forgotten it.\n\nThe blast ripped through the train station, roaring in its hunger. Fire and flame consumed the small station, and rubble flew out everywhere. After a few endless moments the fire began to die down, and all that could be heard was simmering flame and the shrieks of the injured. Emergency services arrived as soon as they could, but they were too late for many, killed in the blast or burned beyond saving. One charred corpse lay sprawled on the ground, his now-cracked watch still ticking on."

Some had to be rushed off to the hospital, while others' wounds were minor or merely mental. the first responders did what they could, and through their bravery the loss of life was as minimized as it could be.\n\nThe physical explosion wasn't the only one caused by the bombing. A firestorm the likes of which hasn't been seen since independence has swept the nation, with everyone pointing fingers and everyone having fingers pointed at them. A shroud of fear has fallen across the Indian people, subtly but universally suffocating the people's sense of security. Government officials now have bigger and more heavily armed escorts, and reports say that paramilitary and radical groups are arming themselves in case this all escalates.\n\nThis is all very disturbing, and the government has wasted no time in taking action. the station, once evacuated, was completely sealed off and is now being thoroughly investigated by India's brightest minds in the field. the people demand a culprit, and if we can't find one then the effects would be devastating. Those behind this would be validated in their ability to get away with such a horrendous crime, radicals would have a new crime to pin on their foes and rally commoners to their cause, and it would be decades before the common people could feel safe again.

Some claim that it would be tasteless to rebuild it and advocate tearing it down and replacing it with a monument, and others still say it's simply not a priority right now, but now they have to defend that idea in debate. Proposals are being put forward, and it's time to decide what should be done.\n\nThe first order of business is a brand new roof, as the old one collapsed in the blast. Several different proposals were written up, but finally a glass roof was the one that garnered the most attention. It would be a very expensive glass roof to be certain, and there are several different ideas, like glass artwork dedicated to the victims spread across the roof.

He told me his name was Jagadish Rao, and he was from the INC. He was trying to find the bomber, and the police were taking their sweet time on every little detail. He'd give me a handsome sum - on the grounds that I finish the investigation in two months or less. Daunting? Maybe. But I'm not one to turn down that kind of money.\n\nSince he's left, I've been trying to find out just where to start. the way I see it, there are two places the bomb could've been from. For one, there's the RSS. Being a militant, extremist organisation, it's not out of the question for them to be behind it. Secondly, the CPI.

But, less than halfway through the interview, I heard a door open, and I was nearly knocked off my feet by what - or who, rather - I saw; Golwalkar himself, Guruji! Here was my big chance. I quickly finished up my interview with Sudarshan, and moved onto Golwalkar.\n\nI started with the same things, before I moved on to the more complicated stuff, such as "where were you when the bombing occurred?". And he answered the questions perfectly - too perfectly, I thought. So, I went through the same questions as prior, with different wording. But he was innocent - and he knew what I was trying to do. And he got mad. Real mad. For an old fascist, he was still as quick and nimble as if he were decades younger! He demanded I leave the building, and never show my face again. Of course, not one to get one someone's bad side, I made like an exorcist, and got the hell out of there. I started thinking - maybe politics wasn't the right place to be looking.

A timeline of India, from its birth to the heroic sacrifice of the bombing victims. the man proposing it, an architect and artist from Madras, has a grand and sweeping vision for such a small thing as train station walls.

Put the faces of the victims on the tiling of the floor! It will show the utmost respect to them and their suffering, and every person using the station will be reminded of the tragic loss of life.\n\nThe people at the station are not trampling the victims, they are being lifted up by them, carried to their destination!

A playground for children would be constructed outside of the station. Kiosks for venders would be scattered around the station so that citizens could acquire goods for their travels.\n\nThe station would be twice the size of the original station and create 100 new jobs.

However, that doesn't mean we can't try our best to offer them something to get them through these awful times. Many of those who died were the providers for their families, hard workers who toiled every day to put food on the family table.\n\nTo do what little we can, the government has approved a pension for the families of the victims. This monthly payment should be enough to pay for food and housing for the foreseeable future and help these unfortunate people get back on their feet after losing both a beloved family member and a household provider. We made sure to make it clear that we know that this doesn't even begin to cover the emotional toll that the victims' loved ones have suffered, and that their sorrow is shared by everyone in the INC and by all the people of India. Many of the families, who were living in poverty even before the bombing, showed endless gratitude for the gesture, and it's good deeds like this that remind us all of the real purpose of government: to serve the people in their hardest times."

Yet in times like these it is when we as citizens of a nation must look around us and think of why these things happen. It is dark force indeed that can lead a citizen who loves his nation astray, and even bring them to commit atrocities. It is a dark force that makes a citizen into a radical. Radicalism is nothing more than a corruption of goodness and patriotism masquerading as egalitarianism and nationalism. On both ends of the political spectrum, a supposed love of one's countrymen leads to hatred of the nation, and those attempts to harm the nation only lead to harm of the beloved countryman. That is the essence of both Communism and Fascism: the promise of love but the delivery of hatred. That is why so many flock to these ideas; they speak of unity even when they promote division, they speak of prosperity while they only cause poverty, and they speak of love but only through mutual hatred.

Violence against minorities, coming mostly from the same paramilitary, has also seen a rise in areas such as Pakistan - only worsening the already poor ethnic tensions.\n\nBut the capital regions have seen their fair share of protests aswell - coming mostly from conservative and market liberal circles, who are openly calling the government corrupt, socialist and un-hinduist."

Fierce arguments have already begun in the parliament, with every party blaming the other for supplying the terror attack with the necessary tools - and just as many parties denying any connection. Most fingers, however, are silently pointed at the RSS, who are notorious for violent activity. the RSS has, however, denied any involvement in the attack, claiming they would have never done this to a good Hindu city. They were quick to blame some Muslim radical groups, but it's rather unlikely considering the location.\n\nPerhaps in this moment, it's best to not bicker about the politics of it, but to mourn the dead - but nobody will budge."

Already, the congress has lost a substantial amount of their voting and political base and there is talk of complete collapse. This could spell the end to the unchallenged rule of the Congress, which has been in control of the country for the past twenty years.\n\nIndira Gandhi has, in a very inspiring speech, proposed that there is no need to panic. the Congress can still be able to function politically, and with time and electoral success, it can be able to once more secure the hearts and minds of the Indian people. She ended her speech with an impassioned call for unity amongst those few who remain securely within the grip of the Congress. They may be temporarily bowed, but they are not broken."

Many voices in the INC have however shown heavy opposition to the program, seeing it as an attack on capitalism, which they believe can be reformed better.

How they rallied so much support so quickly is unclear--perhaps we angered the Muslim population of the region even more than we suspected, and caused them to turn to religious nationalism as a recourse - but the fact remains that we now have to contend with their leadership as we face this trial.\n\nThe news has even worsened the divides within our own internal politics: the leftists are split between letting Pakistan go and opposing the fanaticism of the Mujahideen, the liberals and conservatives wish for the conflict to be resolved with the least bloodshed possible (although, sadly, that will probably still be a great deal), the BJS and RSS are exhorting us to fight the Muslims to the bitter end, and some few idealists still hope against hope for a peaceful compromise.\n\nBut no matter whose path we choose to follow, we cannot avoid the truth: India has been shaken to its very foundations, and we must fight back."

While they have so far been unsuccessful in gaining their independence, a recent string of anti-muslim activity across the republic of India may provide the party with the justification they need to finally suceed. Noon, and the rest of his party feel that the status of muslims within the Republic of India is growing increasingly tenuous. While the government itself has not directly acted against the muslim population in this instance, Noon has highlighted the increasingly common incidents of inter-religious violence across the nation, particularly in regions where several relgious groups converge. With little action on the part of the government to quell this faith-based tension, the AIML have once again raised the call for better representation and protection of muslims. Noon, when pressed as to what lengths his party would go to secure better representation for his fellow muslims, responded that "if necessary, the Muslim League would push for total independence from the Republic of India". the contrast between the decisive AIML and the passive Delhi government has sent a resonating message to many muslims across India. This, coupled with the renewed call for independence by Noon has made it clear to the entire country that the AIML will not be sitting idly by. This of course is an alarm bell for the government, signaling a need for action on the issue of muslim rights. the AIML on the other hand is already seeing positive results. the organisation looks to significantly increase its membership numbers and potentially make major gains in the next election."

This is sure to bring support, but the more right-wing members of the Congress are threatening to leave if the Congress joins with the radical left.\n\nThose members have on the other hand, proposed that no action be taken and that's better to maintain the course of social liberalism, more right-wing than the previous government, but more left-wing than the Swatantra Party or Morarji Desai.

While the Conservatives are slightly more compatible with the party's platform, the disparsity is still fairly large.\n\nFinally, the potentially riskiest option is to attempt to rule alone, and ensure the party remains unified in order to get as many outside votes as possible.

There are reports coming in of residents of coastal villages stubbornly resisting evacuation orders, even going so far as to attack police and army personnel sent to clear them out.\n\nEven so, government organizers have begun drafting plans of action to be executed in the event that the worst case scenario comes true. Indian meteorologists, and a steadily increasing number of observers from around the world, are watching with bated breath to witness what the newly-christened Bhola Cyclone will do next."

Cyclone Bhola will most likely strike the southern coast, buffeting the Ganges Delta with 200 kilometer-per-hour winds and leaving a trail of devastation in its wake, then sweep further north and east, and dissipate over Assam.\n\nThe Azad Hind Government has already begun issuing evacuation orders for the expected zone of effect. Unfortunately, however, the limited resources available to emergency personnel and the large area covered will significantly hinder the operation, and mass civilian casualties are anticipated despite the government's best efforts.\n\nIn a move demonstrative of the rivalry between the two states, and universally mocked by international media, the Indian government has expressed its sorrow and sympathy in a public announcement while refraining from actually sending any usable aid to the Azad Hind."

Our politicians would also be free from the responsibility of dealing with such a massive crisis. That is what we believed when we last checked the meteorological readings and diagrams.\n\nYet something is changing in that cyclone, and despite the pooled resources of all our experts, we cannot garner a stable prediction. It shifts in terms of speed, size and most of all, direction. While there is no reason to raise the alarm just yet, we would be advised to keep a close watch on the storm. Some within the Lok Sabha and our government have suggested that we evacuate the most vulnerable coastal regions a precaution.

With little else for us to do but wait and brace for impact, we can only hope that the evacuations begin in time. It would be pleasant to think that the evacuation will be carried out smoothly and quickly by emergency services and that the storm would find nothing but empty towns and cities to destroy.\n\nIn all likelihood, it would be nowhere near as successful. Entire villagers would be left to face the storm without aid, having received no warnings of the impending catastrophe. Towns and Cities would only be partially evacuated as millions of people try to escape as fast as possible, with the official evacuation seemingly stuck. Worst of though, was the fact that even with the general direction of the cyclone known, the fear of it suddenly during towards another part of the country was causing even more havoc. Now, areas far from the predicted impact zone were being abandoned by thousands more. Roads were clogged with every sort of person trying to flee, whether they were on foot, cart or even by car.

It was however, sloppily executed, having come too late to properly search and evacuate every town and city. Some people even refused to leave their homes. Having done the best they possibly could, emergency services left the coast only a few hours before the storm's arrival.\n\nThe storm came in the morning, hitting Bengal in both the Republic of India and Azad Hind. A number of tiny islands were caught in the cyclone before it made landfall. While few people lived there, their fates were all tragically sealed from the moment the storm hit them. A meteorological station from around 100km away from the point of impact was able to record winds of up to 144 km/h before most of its measuring equipment was torn off by the wind. This was still only the beginning. the Cyclone tore along the coast, ripping up entire towns and villages in the process, taking the lives of tens of thousands with it. the survivors would emerge from the wreckage to find their homes, their crops and their loved ones gone, all taken by the storm.\n\nFootage of the cyclone itself quickly reached both local and international media, reportedly captured by foolhardy amateurs trying to profit from filming the disaster. the footage itself had a profound impact however. the Cyclone was now something more than a few words in the paper. It was real, something you could look at and almost feel and fear from the safety of your front room.

There is still a slight chance that this plan will not work however. the chief minister of Bengal has made it clear to us that infrastructure in the region is in tatters, and that few vehicles will be able to reach the most affected areas.\n\nWe cannot make the storm dissipate, but we can at least track its course. This entire disaster could have been much less awful had we only paid proper attention to meteorological readings. From now on, the government will be informed of any developments regarding the speed or course of the Cyclone. Finally, we must look toward the international community for aid in these most desperate and harrowing times. While we should be able to recover, it would take many years. the death toll is already devastating and is bound to only get worse. That is something that no amount of rebuilding can replace. We should hope that the rest of the world shares our sorrow, so that they might lend us a hand. There is much work to be done, and we already know too well how hard it is going to be"

That was the general feeling among the government of the Republic of India as a massive cyclone hit them. It was to be one of the biggest and most destructive of its kind, displacing millions of people from their homes and causing unmitigated damage to not only cities and towns but to local wildlife as well. While the populace had been informed of the approaching catastrophe, the alert can too late for most, who now had to simply abandon their homes with what little they could carry.\n\nThere was little solace to be had for the government, but least of all for the people themselves. However, that little solace that did exist came in a rather interesting form. the Cyclone was heading east along the coast and it would not take long to cross over into Azad Hind. It was sure to cause just as much, if not more destruction in East India, which gladdened many in the West. To others, it was an opportunity. the Republic, more developed and far larger than Azad Hind, would be able to recover from the cyclone at a faster pace. the damage done to East India would last for longer, leaving them vulnerable to their western rival. It was a tantalising prospect for any politician.\n\nDestruction across Azad Hind was no real comfort when the same destruction would be meted out across the rest of India. It was instead the denial that amused the West Indians, the denial of Free India being allowed to gloat that they had not been harmed.

It could ingratiate us to the Indian people and government, and improve our reputation abroad.

And worse, our humiliation may not yet be over. the government has decided that we have no choice but to approach one of the three superpowers to ask them for much-needed assistance.\n\nWhilst this will undoubtedly allow us access to far greater aid than before, assuming they agree to help of course, there are also risks involved. Whichever superpower aids us will undoubtedly expect something in return. Namely, that we aid them in return during this Cold War.

That doesn't mean that it does not occur, and Dalit are still far behind the other castes.

Some even argue that taking action against them would only validate their power and make the Republic look both paranoid and authoritarian.\n\nThe other solution, proposed by others in the Lok Sabha, is to simply ban them as a legal organization. the argument goes that even without the caste issue, such a large and fanatical paramilitary has no place existing within the borders of a modern nation state.

He couldn't believe his ears when he'd heard the news, but soon enough, it was on every radio and television set. the caste system had been outlawed, in its entirety.\n\nWhat right did those Delhi men in their fancy suits, with their lofty rhetoric and misguided ideals, to tell a Pundit who should and should not be considered a Hindu and admitted into their temples? What right did they have to dictate the culture of the Indian people this way?\n\nDinesh had been raised to be proud of who he was, and his heritage as a member of the Kshatriya caste. A warrior, and a protector of Indian way of life. And now, his government, who claimed to represent him and people like him, wanted to take that away.\n\nHis hand clenched into a fist as he thought of those suited socialists and leftists in the Lok Sabha, celebrating their victory over Indian culture with that arrogant self-assuredness that characterized them.\n\nHe was Kshatriya, and the Kshatriya were warriors. What kind of warrior stood by as men - mere men - sought to slay his heritage with a pen stroke?"

It's even harder to admit it when the cause, the destruction of the caste system, one fought so long and so hard for was righteous, and its most rabid supporters had all of the best intentions.\n\nYet anyone who was not blind could see what the campaign was doing to their beloved nation, their sweet India. Battle lines were being drawn across the nation, caste versus caste and state versus state, party versus party. But it was all Indian against Indian, and those who pushed for the measure seemed willing to fight in the violence that would certainly follow the outlawing of the castes.\n\nThankfully, such a path was averted, as the vote showed overwhelming support to abandon efforts to destroy the Caste System. For a moment, all seemed well.\n\nAnd then Shripad Amrit Dange, leader of the Communists in the Lok Sabha, shot to his feet, his face flushed with rage as he raised a finger into the air.\n\n"Traitors! Cravens and puppets are all that I see before me!" He declared, to the stunned silence of the Lok Sabha. "You who claim to represent India's people, and you who even still sold them, body and soul, to the Pundits and the reactionaries of India! Your children and your children's children will remember this as India's darkest day!"\n\nHe continued, but the remainder of his speech was drowned out by the cacophony of objections and speeches in kind that washed over the Lok Sabha like a flood."

It would seem that all our attempts at forming new offers have produced increasingly poor results, bringing us to the present state of affairs. It is truly unfortunate that we were unable to reach a compromise, as the potential of the resulting relationship would have been rather fruitful. However, it would seem that the steelworks are more interested in forcing us to agree to their ridiculous terms. We will not allow ourselves to be presented as weak and subservient in the eyes of the public. Naturally, this is the end of negotiations with the steelworking plant.\n\nOther companies that had once considered the offer of beginning talks with our administration have now expressed their reservations. At least for now, the plan for a new way of dealing with big companies has been put to rest. Perhaps some more preparation should be made before we ever attempt something like this again.

 demindia.211.desc:0 "One of the largest shared goals of the liberals and the moderate leftists has been a push for a more industrialized India, and so as a coalition that has been a primary goal. the opening of factories and a shift from subsistence agriculture over to more reliable and economically viable industrial jobs has been on the agenda very often, and multiple different actions have been taken to further those goals. While most consider this a good and admirable goal for India, even the most rational course of action will never be without its critics.\n\nThis time, the most outspoken foe of these reforms has been the RSS. the RSS is the militant branch of the fascist forces in India, and unlike many other fascist movements they believe that India's status as an agrarian country is a core part of its national spirit. They claim to speak for the common farmer and laborer, and say that their livelihoods in agriculture are an unshakable pillar that holds up the nation of India. They dispute research showing that industrial jobs raise the quality of life for workers. Because of all this, they rather predictably have chosen to protest the industrialization push, with many prominent members of the RSS speaking out against it. It seems there can be no compromise with them."

 demindia.212.desc:0 "The most recent issue to be debated in the Indian government is the role protectionism should play in the new economic plan for India. the ISI system, short for Import Substitution Industrialization system, is a system that advocates for a nation to replace the imports and production of foreign nations in favor of domestic industry and self-reliance. While fine in theory, how exactly to put it into practice or even whether it's truly valid are both widely debated, and this time those debating it are the MPs of the Lok Sabha. the Lok Sabha is currently run by a coalition, and the two sides of the coalition also roughly define the lines of who's on which side of the debate. the social democrats of the INC are in favor of more protectionism, while the liberals advocate for a toned-down and tweaked implementation.\n\nThose on the side favoring protectionism cite the very core idea of ISI economics, that a nation should rely on its own industry and be as self-reliant as it can be. India is such a major player and producer in international trade, surely it can provide for itself if it can also provide for millions and millions abroad! A self-reliant India is the best option for Indians, and the common people would supposedly benefit the most. the country would provide for its own people and still be a major part of international trade.\n\nOn the other hand, those in favor of a more cautious approach cite the many times protectionism has failed in the past, and how it seems to without fail raise prices both at home and overseas. the Indian economy benefits hugely from international trade, and to try and cut down on that would be foolish. Don't fix what isn't broken, they say! India can still increase its self-reliance without lowering the economic gains it gets by exporting and importing.\n\nEventually, one side won out.

This is the kind of catastrophe that won't just change the government, it will change the future of India. the way that this crisis is handled will set an example for the rest of time, and it could dictate the fate of justice and corruption for decades to come.\n\nSuch a monumental decision simply cannot be taken lightly. There are two options here: cut our losses, or forge ahead. the quickest and hypothetically easiest would be to just nip this in the bud and have the Prime Minister resign. It will be terrible, and could harm our standing in elections for many years, but it could stop further investigation and allow us to maintain credibility and build ourselves back up again.\n\nOf course, we can still push onwards. We have made it this far, and we only have done what we have had to do! There is a way forwards, and with some good luck and organization we can hold together and maintain both credibility and power, and perhaps even the public's trust.

Those are the tactics of authoritarians and dictators, and we cannot stoop to that level.\n\nAfter much deliberation, the unfortunate decision was finally made. [RAJ.GetLeader] would step down as Prime Minister and the nation, people, and party could all move on. As they left the Secretariat Building for the final time, the now-former Prime Minister gave a short but heartfelt speech from the steps. They made sure to keep it as vague as possible as to whether or not they were actually guilty in the hopes that with their departure the inquisition would end, but they did express sincere regret as well as hope that India's future was still as bright as ever without them leading it.

From a young age, he advocated for a free and united India, and despite being a Muslim he always firmly held that India was one nation, undivided by faith, tongue, or creed. He served as a leader for Indian Muslims who loved their nation and did not want to divide the subcontinent along a line so arbitrary as religion. After decades of advocacy and hard work, he managed to attain a position in the Bombay High Court, bringing justice and fairness with a strong moral compass. After independence, his talent for bringing people together and uniting people who thought themselves foes made him a gifted diplomat, and he served as the ambassador to the United States of America in the late fifties and early sixties. He performed just as wonderfully in this position as all others he had taken on, and eventually he was offered a position as a Cabinet Minister, which he dutifully accepted. He is now a spectacular Foreign Minister, and he has been brought to trial.\n\nChagla's past as a man of justice and his decades of loyal service make him a very trusted figure. His work to bring people of all faiths together under a single India have ensured that he is well-loved, and you would be hard-pressed to find a single Indian who wouldn't at least respect him and his work. We hope that this impeccable record will stay unsullied by the end of these trials."

His credibility has made this even harder on us, as few will doubt him, and if one so moral as him has been corrupted then what does it say about the rest of the government?\n\nThe trial began with those in attendance holding their breath. Chagla's voice is trusted, and what he would say would have an effect on everything. However, it ended as soon as it began. the shock was palpable when he pleaded guilty to the crimes. He gave in without a fight, and with his admission of guilt it is all but certain that the rest are guilty to degree as well in the mind of the public. These aren't solo crimes, after all, and if he has been corrupted then there is no doubt that the rest of the government has been too!

Those following the trial have been surprised greatly by this development, and some refuse to believe that Chagla, a man of justice and ethics, would ever participate in the corruption he's been found guilty of.\n\nThe trial was long and hard, with Chagla being questioned about years of government work and somewhat questionable money flows. Their interrogation was harsh and unforgiving, and they clearly didn't plan on letting him go simply because of his reputation. However, Chagla remained calm and collected throughout the trial. His voice remained steady and his story never changed. He acted professional against all odds, but it simply wasn't enough. No matter how good and reasonable his story seemed, the evidence was too stacked against him. the judge found him guilty, and he left the courtroom with his reputation destroyed and his future ruined.

Chagla remains a free man and a loyal servant of the people and government of all India, no matter how hard some tried to bring him down.\n\nThe trial was very tense from start to finish. Chagla was questioned intensely about suspicious transactions, corruption, and government business, but he remained reasonable and calm throughout. He expertly wove his way through questions that would trap other men, and watching him deflect the barbs of the interrogating lawyers was like watching an expert fencer disarm a newcomer. Eventually, after his spectacular testimony, the judge declared with no doubt that Chagla was not guilty, and he left the courtroom unharmed. However, this isn't over.

Chavan, like many others high up in the INC government, was a devoted and hardworking leader in the fight for independence against the British. Even from a very young age, he was dedicated to the cause of freedom, and he was fined for serving in Mahatma Gandhi's movement and even served jail time for proudly raising the Indian flag in Satara. As he grew older, his conviction only grew stronger, and he was soon serving in the INC among revolutionary heroes like Patel and even Nehru. He was arrested again for protesting the British occupation during the world war, but he never wavered.\n\nAfter independence, Chavan continued to work to maintain the free India he had helped create. After doing much in the 40s and 50s, he eventually became Defense Minister under Nehru's government, and it is in that position that he is to be tried. the idea that such great Indian heroes could be implicated in such shady dealings is horrifying both to the INC and to the people of India, and it can only be hoped that he will be found innocent of these terrible crimes and reassure the people of our good intentions."

He has been taken into custody, and we can only guess at all the information he is spilling there. While he did not save himself, the INC must hold on to the tiny strand of hope that he will try to spare his comrades and only implicate himself in these crimes of corruption. If he claims to only know about his own wrongdoings, then there will still be a flickering light for the rest to hold on to as they are tried.

Chavan, often called the "Leader of Common People", has now not only been found guilty of corruption but also lying in court to save his own hide, tarnishing the reputation of a beloved Indian hero.\n\nThe trial started out as well as it could, with Chavan satisfactorily answering questions to keep himself free of guilt. However, as the trial dragged on and the questioning grew more intense, even a man like Chavan had difficulty keeping pace, and eventually he began to speak a tad less clearly and with a more nervous tone. As those questioning Chavan pushed further and further he was backed into a corner and parts of his story were no longer lining up. While he made it without ever fully breaking, the cracks in his story eventually were enough for the judge to bring down the hammer and shatter him. We can only pray that it will go better from here."

He quickly and concisely answered any question meant to slip through his defenses, and the interrogators were often more flustered than he was trying to get him to fail. Eventually, he held his ground well enough that it became clear that he would not break. There were no more questions to be asked and no more answers to be found. Chavan left the court a free man.

He is an adept economist who is most well known for his expertise in labor issues, and his bright mind has been put to great use in these matters. Furthermore, he has even served as interim Prime Minister, guiding the country through the hard times right after Nehru's death until new elections could be held. Only a great man could have so deftly kept India on track through the death of an Indian hero like Nehru, and Nanda was up to the task.\n\nNow serving as Economic Minister, Nanda's involvement in the corruption scandal has many holding their breath. As an economist, few would know the devastation corruption can have on a country like he does, and if he were to throw that aside for personal gain anyways it would be a terrible show of his personality. the INC hopes that he will be able to use his keen mind to argue his way out of this trial and make it to the other end mostly unscathed, as an economic minister caught up in corruption is even more severe than the others due to their power over the economic status and security of the country."

None of the witnesses' testimony was horrifying or terrible, just talk of the kind of bureaucratic crime that is dull and mundane enough to slip under the radar and get ignored in favor of scarier, showier crimes. This all worked to Dikshit's advantage, and he was declared innocent of his tedious wrongdoings. After that, we get to perhaps the flashiest and most interesting of the trials: the Prime Minister's. Dikshit's trial was usual judiciary monotony, but the leader's promises to be anything but."

There would also be harsher punishments for hate-motivated crimes.\n\nThe act has been unsurprisingly harshly opposed by the fascist and conservative wings of the Lok Sabha, but more interesting is the uneasiness with the bill from the very party proposing it. Many liberals claim that they support equality in India, but that this act will infringe on the rights of Indian business owners and do harm to the nation's economy by supposedly forcing businesses to hire less qualified workers to meet quotas. However, there are many more saying that this bill must be passed in order to protect the minorities of India and show that the liberals really do care.\n\nAfter seemingly endless debate, the act was put to a vote. the conservatives and other far-right MPs were obviously going to vote against it, but the leadership held its breath in anticipation of whether their party could come together behind this bill or if they would split and let it die."

Its leadership has come out with scathing criticisms and ruthless denunciations in response to what they claim is a direct act of government-level discrimination and oppression of Indian minorities, Muslims in particular. As perhaps the largest minority, and the one with the most tension with the rest of India to boot, Islam was one of the main targets of the Indian Ethnic Equality Act despite its name, and so the AIML's outrage at its failure is at least understandable.\n\nThe government has had a good deal of trouble responding to these criticisms. the liberals claim that this is not any sign of discrimination but rather a reaffirmation of true equality. Some in the government are even siding with the AIML, claiming that if the liberals want to show they are just as beneficial to the common man as they claim to be then there need to be protections for oppressed groups. All this has just served to further strain the already tense relationship with the AIML and Indian Muslims as a whole, and the consequences could be drastic if the situation isn't handled properly."

Despite it being treated as a serious affair, most of the party was as at this point almost as thrilled as the opposition to see her leave. Still, none of this was made too obvious around the actual time of the removal. It was only afterwards that their actual opinions become apparent. Then, the mood became somewhat more upbeat amongst the INC, even if it was still kept within their own circles, although they were now left with the difficult task of rebuilding the parties reputation. Still, this would be much easier with Indira Gandhi. Kumaraswami Kamaraj was to be the replacement, having served as the party president up until this point. There is a certain irony in the fact that the man who helped the former prime minister gain her position would now be the one to replace her. Now, the INC would have to reclaim their lost status among Indian politics and then hopefully survive the next election without too much damage."

One man, however, had a different vision. He thought that India's best hope for freedom was to cooperate with the new order, not fight against it. That man was Subhas Chandra Bose, and with no other choice in his eyes he made a deal with the Axis powers, promising them a free India amicable to their interests. As the people of India threw off the chains of the West, new would-be masters pushed in from the East with their loyal puppet. They pushed all the way across Bengal before India was able to hold the line. Since then, India has been split apart, and in the wild jungles and crowded cities of Bengal the people still lie under an imperial tyrant.\n\nThat ends now.\n\nThis conflict has been building ever since Bose turned his back on the people of India in favor of collaborating with foreign oppressors. His misguided efforts broke a nation, and those he betrayed are now obligated to fix it. the people of India cannot stand back and watch their brothers and sisters toil under a new master as if the British had never left. It is time for all Indians to be free, not just those who were lucky enough to be on one side of a ceasefire line! the War of Independence will never end until every Indian citizen is free! the struggle will be hard, and we will have to wipe our tears aside as Indian fights against Indian once more, but we will persevere knowing that it is for the good of all of the peoples of the subcontinent.

We are of course really interested in bringing the region back into our nation, and in the process weaken both Japan and their puppet in Bengal. In order for this plan to work, we will have to be swift. A drawn-drawn out conflict would result in us losing the momentum necessary to ensure our victory. the invasion must be planned with utmost precaution. Failure may bring the Sphere into the conflict, and that would surely put an end to any dream of regaining our territory.\n\nThere is also the option to simply withdraw from the region entirely and put any hopes of gaining territory at this time to rest.

Although, the situation in Japan may eventually change, leaving them with no choice but to negotiate with us. Regardless of what options we have, Bengal will be part of our nation again.

An official was then charged with looking over all the documents produced by the proceedings of the day. He quickly gathered them up and headed home to finish his work for the day. As he worked late into the night, he eventually reached the end of the papers marked "passed legislation". It was there that he found Act No. 1400. This act had not been included among the matters voted upon and so he made sure check through what it contained. A brief glance at it, and the relevant parts of the Indian Constitution quickly showed that it had quite the impact.\n\nAfter a small bit of pleading with his superior, he was granted permission be allowed to present his findings to the assembled politicians. the government were keen to get this "presentation" out of the way, having other more serious matters to attend to. As the official spoke of his discoveries, the mood went from mild boredom to panic. Act No. 1400 had gone in direct violation of the Indian constitution and by passing it, had overwritten several pieces of earlier legislation. "Act No. 1400 states that India is to country were all the lands and resources belong to the people of India, but our current constitution states land and resources are available to be privately as well as publicly owned." A half-finished proposal made by the government had found itself included in minor vote on a minor infrastructure project.

Each day, enormous mounds of paperwork are created, detailing just how much of the constitution needs to be re-written in order to allow for Act No. 1400 to pass without violating current laws. the paperwork is then slowly sorted through as hundreds of government officials try to find out why this happened. Numerous violations and loopholes have been discovered in the process, and now the paperworks only mounts as more officials are tasked with resolving them and finding ways to alter legislation quickly enough to prevent further violations in future. With the end of this task being nowhere near in site, it seems that the government will have to examine every aspect and potential interpretation of the constitution in order guarantee that every error is swiftly resolved. the process is lengthy, and so government must now figure out who will be taking the blame for the mess. They might have been the ones to pass the act, but they would not be the ones held responsible for the disaster that followed, the government would make sure of that."

Seemingly, not a single argument has so far gone unused to some capacity with everything from misprints in document containing Act No. 1400 to outside pressure causing the act to be rushed through parliament without being properly examined first. Most commonly brought up by the government were their reports on what investigating into the constitution had yielded. Almost every day in parliament, a new pile of papers would be wielded in a trolley. Then, whoever was speaking on behalf of the ruling party would take their pick of the provided documents and read through what had been discovered. On one day, the government might read "Act No. 1400 goes in violation of already established laws" or on another, "Act No. 1400 should not have been able to pass according to our findings". These points would be usually finished with a comment on the "flawed and rushed nature of the constitution". Whether their tactics have been effective is quite a different matter however. Many in parliament suggest that this is merely a way for the government to bide their time until the investigation can scrape together a decent enough excuse for their hand in causing the crisis."

They insisted that it was more irresponsible of the current government to have allowed the act to pass without checking the constitution first and that this was the real cause of the crisis. They were, however largely ignored. Other groups unhappy with the INC taking the fall were the BJS and the RSS. This was to be expected however, as the two parties were ardament opponents of the government and for once took to the side of the INC, even if their "support" was somewhat cold and opportunistic. the rest of the Lok Sabha were rather uninterested in truth, and simply keen to get on with the usual state of affairs."

With that, the crisis ended, and it seemed that the socialists had managed to come away from it scot-free. Today, the government announced that it would be shuffling a number of its politicians. However, there was no mention of why this was happening. Despite this sudden and somewhat bizarre decision, there is no little to be made of it. No one is quite sure why the government has taken this step, but a shuffle of politicians is usually a healthy, and quite beneficial tactic in any democratic system. A number of theories have been put forward to explain the government's actions. Some believe that they are merely trying to get some fresh faces from the party involved in government matters. Others are suggesting that the shuffle has occurred as a means to punish those the socialists believe partly responsible for Act No. 1400 and the ensuing crisis. Either way, they would likely not know the answer, as the government was quick to move, quite keen to not make a fuss about the whole affair. Besides, most are just happy to see it as a sign of the healthy Indian democracy."

First of all, there was the crisis that resulted from Act No. 1400, and now, the preparations for the creation of the new constitution. Following the end of the crisis, the socialist government had made the decision that through an updated constitution, they would be able to prevent errors like Act No. 1400 from ever occurring again. And so, the preparations were under way. Every member of the Lok Sabha, from every party would be able to leave their mark upon it, although some would perhaps leave larger ones.\n\nAfter the various discussions and inevitable arguments followed by several drafts and thorough checks, the new constitution was finished. Although the mood was still tense, that was another thing that never changed in the Lok Sabha, there was an unusual sense of shared satisfaction too. It was less to do with the constitution itself, for the final product was somewhat of a mess, the inevitable result of too many authors working on it, but rather do with the hopes that they would never have to deal with the likes of another Act No. 1400 dilemma again. Regardless of their opinion of the socialists, no party in their right minds wanted to work with the old constitution, now that it's deep flaws had been revealed. the creation of this new document was a rare moment, one in which the Lok Sabha was united to the greatest extent that it reasonably could be, for politics is too vicious of a game to allow for anything more. A crisis has now been averted, and most politicians are happy for a return to the usual order of things."

This all changed however when the Speaker announced that one of the new principles of the Indian constitution was...socialism. the socialists were obviously pleased, they were the ones to include it, and so their smiles only widened upon hearing the cries and angry shouts of the opposition parties. There was little more to be done, the constitution was complete and everyone had already included their own parts, this was a merely segment of the socialists contribution. Despite this argument, the opposition did not simmer down and their shouting did not cease until the meeting was adjourned. the news of the new constitution and it's somewhat controversial principle quickly spread around India and the reaction from the population was in many ways much the same as in the Lok Sabha. Large crowds gathered in both support of and in protest of the government, though they quickly died down within a few hours, either running out of steam or being dispersed by police. the socialists might have enraged their political opponents, but that was a small price to pay. Their actions had only made them even more popular among their supporters and their position in the Lok Sabha was now nothing if not secure."

One of Desai's bodyguards had spotted him almost immediately after firing his pistol and tackled him to the ground. the third was that that assassin told the police everything. "Who hired you?" They asked him. "Indira Gandhi," he replied. At first, the police were suspicious of his claim, but even after beating him for a few more minutes, his story did not change. Upon searching his room in a small hotel, they found a number of documents that eventually lead to back to... Indira Gandhi.\n\nAs hard as the police might have tried to keep this investigation under wraps, it soon leaked to the press. With the story in their hands, it spread like wildfire across India and by the next day everyone knew just how "dedicated" Indira Gandhi was to getting her way. Despite the danger that he was only recently exposed to, Desai was in parliament the next day, ready to confront the woman who had just tried to have killed. the mood could only be described as furious, as politicians regardless of allegiance freely expressed their outrage at the actions of the INC leader. But Indira was nowhere to be found, and instead the deputy Prime Minister was left to hold the fort against the rest of parliament. Not even the INC stood together, with several of their politicians in open rebellion. It would be hard to come up with a worse disaster for the government to face, with their leader essentially caught red-handed, many began to suggest that "Gandhi might not be the only one behind this vicious attack on our democracy!"\n\nParliament was one matter, but the reaction from the general public made the angriest of politicians seem quite tame in comparison.

By providing more opportunity for all in the cities, we hope to reduce the divide between urban and rural areas. No longer wealth be concentrated into the cities, but even distributed to all parts of India. the promotion of atheism will be another focus of the plan, as we hope to greatly weaken the hold that religion still has on the vast majority of the population and by doing so, eliminate superstition and ignorance. By doing so, this will become another part of our equal society, where religion will no longer have the hold that it does over India, and that does not divide us into groups based on faith. This will be done in combination with our education programs, while the older generations are likely too set in their ways, we can always bring the children round with our new ideas.\n\nThere are many powerful nations on this Earth, and if India wishes to compete with them at the very least, then it must swiftly leap into modern age, free from the binding chains of the past.

No longer will wealth be concentrated into the cities, but even distributed to all parts of India. the promotion of atheism will be another focus of the plan, as we hope to greatly weaken the hold that religion still has on the vast majority of the population and by doing so, eliminate superstition and ignorance. By doing so, this will become another part of our equal society, where religion will no longer have the hold that it does over India, and that does not divide us into groups based on faith. This will be done in combination with our education programs, while the older generations are likely too set in their ways, we can always bring the children round with our new ideas.\n\nThere are many powerful nations on this Earth, and if India wishes to compete with them at the very least, then it must swiftly leap into modern age, free from the binding chains of the past. India is to be a shining beacon of progress and equality for all."

All is not lost either, we may need to reconsider our methods of implementing our reforms but there are number of ways to work these through the Lok Sabha, even if they are not part of a five-year plan. Either way, we cannot deny that this is a major setback for everything we are hoping to bring to India. We will need to work quickly to find a new plan that will assuredly get through the Lok Sabha. Our many promises made during the election must be fulfilled if we wish to stand any chance of winning future elections.

India shall no longer be known as an agrarian nation, but as an industrial and modern nation. Another source of pride for us is that was an entirely independent effort. We our a nation capable of managing our own future, we have no need of big, foreign business meddling in our economy. While the construction of the factories was an achievement in its own right, perhaps the real cause for celebration was how successfully we managed to incentivise the new jobs that the new heavy industry provided. Thousands have flocked to the cities, seeking employment. Soon, the new factories were operating at full capacity and many Indians, that were once destitute and trapped in the countryside are now employed and settled in cities across the nation. As our industry expands, India will only prosper more and more. Our cities will be places of hope and opportunity for all. the first leg of the Sixth Five-Year Plan has gone just as well as we had hoped, and we can fully commit to the next step."

Secondly, some factories unrelated to this entire endeavor had to shut down, due to a lack of money or workers or any number of problems. Finally, of course, this entire thing is going to be in the news, and this kind of disaster is going to make us look like fools in the press, so there's that.\n\nSo, needless to say, things aren't looking up right now. We should focus on re-organizing ourselves and maybe focusing on other endeavours to get this bad press off of us.

Many have recently moved from the countryside to bigger towns and even cities, abandoning agricultural work that their ancestors had done for millenia. They sought opportunity, and thanks to the Five Year Plan, it seems as though they might have just found it.\n\nThanks to recent advances in agricultural technology reaching India, it is hoped that our sector dedicated to growing crops and food will not suffer due to this shift in labor. While there have been concerns from rural communities, the government has done its best to reassure them at every turn that this only stands to benefit all the people of the nation. More opportunity and choices for better work can only be good for the country and its people. Let's wish all these new laborers a good first day on the job!"

Laborers were subjected to brutal shifts doing very hard and sometimes slightly dangerous work, and their breaks provided barely enough time to take a breath, let alone rest and prepare for more back-breaking labor. Families were appalled as husbands and sons came back weary, miserable, and even occasionally slightly injured from the sheer amount of heavy work. People took these jobs hoping for opportunity, and soon learned that the pay of an industrial job was not proportional to the work done to earn it.\n\nAs if the morale loss wasn't bad enough, many workers have rallied under figures who question whether these conditions are even legal. Safety is blatantly a secondary concern to profit, and there have already been many reports of workplace injuries and even deaths. Furthermore, while the pay is generally better than subsistence farming, a majority of workers are adamant in claiming that it isn't nearly the compensation that should be required for this kind of work. There are also concerns of cruel work environments and illegally long shifts being worked six days a week. Exhausted and injured workers are demanding changes, and since no company will ever put its workers before its bottom line, it's up to the government to force them to. What to do is quite the difficult question indeed."

Hundreds of new apartment blocks and houses have been constructed and paid for out of pocket by the government to remedy this issue. These homes are at a perfect proximity from many industrial facilities, meaning that workers are close enough to travel quickly to and from their jobs while still far away enough to be safe.\n\nIt seems as though these construction efforts have paid off. Thousands of workers are now entering their brand new homes with their families, having decent and secure housing often for the first time in their lives. Their children are absolutely floored and run through their new places of living, playing and happy to finally have a real home as good as this. Even if they are in fact a little small and inexpensive, it goes to show the power of perspective. Now, workers will be able to afford decent homes near their place of work without working more than the obscene amount they already do."

Thousands of dwellings are occupied by dozens of tenants in the most extreme cases. These huge government-funded housing projects are simply going unoccupied. Some people cannot afford the surrounding costs of living, some don't wish to move and leave their homes, and in many cases there just aren't enough industrial workers to fill the houses.\n\nThis has been one of the biggest wastes of money in recent memory, and the government is scrambling to see where they went wrong, and more importantly what to do about it. Maybe these can at least be used to alleviate problems of homelessness? That would cost millions more and drafts of many new bills, but it would at least be something. Are there any other ideas? Has this much money really been just plain wasted on empty houses?"

Thousands of Indians now have jobs provided straight from the government to do honest work and bring home food and earnings to their families. Providing safer and fairer competition to private factories, these work facilities are the best any Indian worker could hope for.\n\nThis is a major win for the Five-Year Plan. There were major worries about the viability of government-run factories and how the populace might response, but it seems to have been an overall success. With workers now being provided a good alternative, the greedy capitalist factory owners will have to reconsider their standards for their employees. the Indian worker now works for his country, not for his exploiter."

Demanding better conditions and wages, these protesters have denounced the government's practices in the new factories, claiming that they represent the very greed and exploitation they supposedly combat. the workers soon organized and took to the streets, going on strike.\n\nThe fallout has been terrible. People are outright refusing to take jobs in the government factories, leaving many understaffed and one or two completely empty and non-functional. the government is desperately trying to react and negotiate with the strikers, but the damage is already being done as factories are forced to close down until they can get their workers back on the assembly lines. the government may end up losing more if they give in to the demands of the strikers, as the measures required would not be cheap by any measure.

Now, the government is giving them the money, tools, and training to bring their practice into the modern era.\n\nIt's not just updating old farms. Thousands and thousands of acres, until recently empty and used by none, have been plowed and sowed using sophisticated machinery and techniques, and farmers have been given incentives to move to and work on these lands. Hundreds of farms have opened, each one using modern methods and machines to farm India's fertile soil. All together, this should mean that crop outputs will be boosted significantly, and subsistence farmers operating in local markets will now have their goods sold in stores around the entire nation, benefiting both the farmer and the buyer."

This is a failure that will have, and in many places already is having, a horrible effect on not just some economist's notepad but the lives of real people.\n\nEfforts to bring subsistence farmers into the modern age proved difficult at best and comedically doomed at worst. Many just completely refused, suspicious of these non-traditional methods. In many places the machines and techniques were completely misused due to improper training and knowledge, meaning that many farms actually lowered their outputs. This is to say nothing of the attempts to expand farmland into unused land, only to find that few were willing to actually move and come work the new land. Fields lay barren and cropless, torn up for agriculture then left to the elements.\n\nThat's not the worst of this. the effects of this botched effort aren't just showing on government budget reports. Many subsistence farmers now grow barely enough to feed themselves and perhaps not even that, meaning that the amount of food being sold is much lower. People are truly starting to go hungry and even starve. This could be the start of a major disaster."

In fact, wheat quotas were exceeded very slightly, while rice quotas were even higher! Prevention of starvation is of utmost importance in a nation like India, where so many are already on the brink of hunger. A rise in food prices here would mean millions would have to go without their meals.\n\nWith the success of the quotas proven, it's certain that they will continue into years future, and they will be raised alongside the growing population and agricultural development of India. This program benefits all, as it encourages farmers to grow more and make higher profits while also ensuring the security of all Indians. Let's hope for the quotas to be exceeded every year."

Famine has begun.\n\nRural villages have been hit the hardest by far. Empty carts lie abandoned in the street, for they have no harvest to carry. Women angrily haggle over stale bread and mushy, borderline rotten fruit, with exorbitant prices being charged for even these things that would be pig slop in better times. Children play in the street, though with less energy than they once did, and with their ribs showing through their underfed frames. City dwellers, while not hit quite as hard, are also feeling the effects, as the prices of even basic food and bread rise every day. Famine has come to exact its toll upon India."

His actions against the British Occupation of India struck a chord with the younger generations of his time, which made him a folk hero among many in India today. the idea to erect a monument in his honour has been floating around for a few years now, ever since India freed itself from British rule. Several locations were proposed, but it was the choice of his home village of Banga in Punjab that won. Although an atheist and socialist, Singh has even gained Hindu nationalist admirers among many other groups. the statue was to be unveiled in accordance to the annual memorial fair that is held in Banga each year on the 23rd of March, the date being the anniversary of when Singh died. Although the weather delayed the installation on a few occasions, the statue was indeed completed and fitted in time. Some complaints were of course raised by those wondering if that state had money to spend of such monuments, but they were mostly drowned out by those in support.\n\nLarge crowds gathered in the small village to see the statue of someone who many considered to be one of the greatest Indians. Apart from the usual events at the fair, the Prime Minister and several regional figures were in attendance to say some words about Bhagat Singh. Upon finishing his speech, the Governor of Punjab pulled back the red cloth that had been covering the statue. There stood a life-size likeness of Singh, made out of Bronze and surrounded by powerful lights to make it shine at night. Singh was depicted holding up his right arm with closed fist. As expected, Singh also had his hat. the reveal was quickly followed by enthusiastic applause from the assembled crowd, pleased to see that Banga had gained such an excellent likeness of their local hero."

Just today, a whole crowd of people came to protest the statue, marching side by side towards it while singing songs and chanting slogans.\n\nSingh was always a controversial person; the British never liked him because he opposed colonial rule, and used violence in order to overthrow their authority. Quite famously, he and Shivaram Rajguru assassinated British police officer John Saunders, having mistaken him for police superintendent James Scott. Needless to say, a Republican India post-Gandhi is not exactly enthusiastic about the celebration of someone who used revolutionary violence, even if they were patriotic. Furthermore, Singh's worldview certainly does not line up with liberal democratic ideology. He was fascinated by the doctrines of anarchism and communism, and admired Marx, Lenin and Trotsky. Singh would argue that Gandhian ideology would not be enough for India to be a free, independent state, and instead advocated for a more libertarian ideology. This would also appear in the form of anti-religious sentiment; he once said that "The ultimate goal of Anarchism is complete independence, according to which no one will be obsessed with God or religion, nor will anybody be crazy for money or other worldly desires. There will be no chains on the body or control by the state. This means that they want to eliminate: the Church, God and Religion; the state; Private property."\n\nOf course, despite all of this, many still view him as a patriot and a hero, and are glad to see the statue in place. Some like the statue because of what he believed in, be they anarchists or socialists. Needless to say, the literal enemies of the republic praising this man isn't exactly a good look, so we'll have to wait and see how this plays out. Maybe people will just forget."

These were lofty promises and although some diehard supporters were enthusiastic about the notion of a second attempt, the majority of Indians were not pleased or at all enthused.\n\nThe Five Year Plan had been of little use to them, causing more harm than good in many cases.

During these past few years, we have proven that we can strive for better and achieve just that through careful planning and bold reform".

Food, now controlled and managed by workers and aided by government, was in plentiful supply for all. Many regions that were at risk of famine now experienced a sense of security once unknown to the people there. Religious divides seemed to become less apparent, as secularised politics and social customs began to be normalised. Atheistic education aided the secularisation process too and provided schools with the chance to provide a diverse and varied education for all Indian children.\n\nFor the opposition, the entire event was somewhat of a disaster. Many of them had predicted and preached the inevitable failure of the five year plan. To witness the complete opposite occur was a clear source of embarrassment for them.

Already the parties of Lok Sabha are considering where their vote will lie and with such short notice, it is too hard to make an accurate prediction as to the result. These next few days will determine the political future of Morarji Desai, and as to which wing of the party will claim victory in the ensuing power struggle."

"Would we be better off without Desai as Prime Minister?", "Could Vajpayee be a worse man for the job?", and other such questions ran through the minds of each and every MP as they settled into the semicircular chamber of the Lok Sabha to cast their vote. With all of the attending MPs gathered, the voting began as each vote was counted one by one. With so many members of the Lok Sabha casting their vote, most of the assembled men and women eventually lost count. Finally, the result was read aloud by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha which resulted in a mixture of restrained celebration and quiet acceptance of defeat.\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party had succeeded in removing Prime Minister Desai from office. As expected, his successor is to be the leader of the Hindu nationalist party; Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Vajpayee himself is far less secular than any other leader India has seen, having originally served as a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and, later, the now-defunct Bharatiya Jana Sangh. His ascension to the office of Prime Minister marks a distinct shift in the ideology of India, with the moderates now taking the backseat. More importantly, Vajpayee's promotion to Prime Minister has been a victory for Hindutva in general, with RSS already warming up to the new Prime Minister. the removal of Desai is certainly a serious blow to the forces of freedom, although it is not yet fatal. Despite their loss of control, they still hold considerable hold over the party. Desai himself has quietly accepted this defeat, but assured the people that he is far from done with politics."

 demindia.4190.desc:0 "We had hoped that by enthusiastically encouraging more immigrantion to our cities, India would experience a massive leap on the road towards modernisation and eventually socialism. However, it would seem that sheer amount of immigrant has greatly exceeded our expectations. Initially, this was met with much celebration and jubilation. After all, it did indeed appear like the plan had worked exceptionally well. As the moment of joy passed, it became increasingly that far too many people were now seeking residence and work in cities across the country. Said residences and jobs have yet to be created.\n\nWe had hoped that the vast majority of these migrants would be quickly settled and given worked, buying us time to deal with the rest. This has turned out to be quite impossible, as employment centres are currently too crowded to properly organise. the lack of available housing has perhaps been the worst problem of all though. Now that they have realised that most of the housing is still under construction, the migrant workers have started demanding that we find them places to stay or else they will return to their homes in the countryside. Those that have no homes in the country to return to have resorted to building shanty-towns. Along the outside of many a city, is a growing field of tents and scrap-iron shacks for as far as the eye can see. It's a sight that the press have grown fond of. We've got a lot of work to undo this mess, but there's no need to panic just yet."

 demindia.4200.desc:0 "We had hoped that a modest and slightly restrained approach to encouraging immigration would have yielded a good result without too much risk. As it turns out, this has been the case in some cities and in others not. Local authorities in some of the better prepared cities are reporting that immigrants have been successfully housed and employed in state-run industrial works. However, many other cities are reporting that either far too few migrants have arrived, or that there are far too many to handle. the overcrowded cities are struggling with organising the newcomers from the countryside, many of whom have been forced to essentially camp out while they wait for any sort of proper housing to become available. On the other hand, the cities with few immigrants are already having to suspend operations in a number of new industrial plants. Housing estates sit mostly empty and many wonder if these brand-new buildings will end up being torn down within the year.\n\nThe sheer contrast between the problems facing our cities right is certainly a cause for concern. the urbanisation plan could end up on the rocks if no one can actually live and work in the cities. However, a potential solution already presents itself. If we were to transport some of the workers to the cities in need of more manpower, we could quickly save face. the empty houses and apartments would be saved and the factories would be able to resume operation without too much delay. Hopefully, the migrants will be willing to travel a few extra kilometres for work and a place to live."

Meanwhile, the rural regions would be left by the wayside, leaving an enormous and vital part of India to stagnate. As such, we decided that the best course of action was to keep urbanisation as uninfluenced and natural as possible. As new factories open and new housing is constructed, a steady stream of people looking for a new life in the cities would arrive at a more sustainable rate.\n\nIt looks as if this is not going to be the case however. We were of course expecting a small amount of migration, prompted our construction projects. Unfortunately, said small amount has amounted to only a few thousand workers. the factories were expecting to employ around ten times that number and several dozen apartment buildings are going to sit mostly empty, unless more migrants materialise in the next few days. Already, some of the workers are beginning to complain about how empty their communities are. This is of course somewhat of an embarassment, but we can bounce back if the proper steps are taken. First of all, raise the level of immigration to fill the factories. Then,bring media attention to the success of our migration policy, focusing on the balance we have achieved between urban growth and rural preservation. As long as we get to work immediately, this fiasco can be left way behind us."

Factories, built for the express purpose of employing the migrants have have also experienced difficulties in beginning operation. Few of the expected employees have been able to actually get their jobs on schedule. the opposition has condemned the urbanisation campaign as "an embarrassment", and have gone on to suggest that poor planning and "naive optimism" were the main factor behind the mismanagement.\n\nHowever, recent observation of the situation now suggests that the worst may be over. With some direct involvement from the government itself, more migrants are beginning to settle into their accommodation. the factories are also expecting that their workforce will have doubled by the end of the week. A spokesperson from the government has stated that "The difficulties we have faced stem more from the scale of the operation, rather than any lack of preparation on our part". While the wheels of the urbanisation campaign are now turning, there is still a long way to go before it will be out of the rut."

In the past weeks, the urbanisation campaign had struggled to function as intended, with few apartments being properly assigned to workers and most factories lacking the required levels of manpower. More recently however, these problems have been reduced significantly.\n\nWhile workers have now been able to work and live in the cities, new concerns have been raised over the quality of the housing. Issues regarding plumbing and electricity have been noted by the program's opponents, based on a number of photos depicting building-wide power cuts. Government sources claim these issues are not widespread and that they are being resolved as soon as they appear. Another issue comes in the form of transporting family members to the cities. Many migrants traveled alone to the cities, hoping to bring their families along once they had settled in. It appears that no plans had been made for this by the organisers of the urbanisation campaign, although the Prime Minister has suggested that this will be rectified in the near future, with new buses that will connect the countryside to the growing industrial cities.\n\nAs the migrant workers begin to grow accustomed to their new lives, it becomes apparent that there are still some problems to work out before the urbanisation policy can be declared a full success."

This message has come a few days later than expected, as after problems were reported with electricity and plumbing in the apartments designed for migrant workers, the minister was forced the delay the official completion announcement. Despite this, the government has been quick to move on from the problems the urbanisation campaign faced, instead focusing on its successes and now, completion. In a press address, the minster stated that: "We have achieved a great deal during a short period of time. New housing and factories have been built, and have already effectively integrated into the cities around them. We are proud of all those that have aided this campaign, and wish to highlight that we have achieved this in dozens of cities around India". Others have not had such positive things to say regarding the campaign. Many opposition leaders have criticised the government for what they have called "poor planning and execution", relating to the difficulties that local authorities faced in providing migrants with the expected housing and jobs.\n\nThe workers themselves have also expressed their opinions on the matter. Some have echoed the concerns of the opposition, whereas others have expressed disappointment that transportation for their families was not initially provided. However, most express happiness to have been given a chance to live in the cities, where the prospects for their children are somewhat better. Recently, another group has entered the fray regarding urbanisation. These are mostly from the countryside and hope to see an end to the rapid expansion of cities. These environmental protectionists fear that industrial districts are harming wildlife, particularly the smog that they produce. These groups worry that if the unrestrained urbanisation does not stop, then "India will lose much of its natural beauty if the smog continues to pollute. These animals and plants can be replaced, they must be protected!" While some agrarian-focused politicians have shown support for the groups, their plea has been somewhat overshadowed.\n\nThe government has yet to comment on if they plan to commit to further urbanisation plans and seem to be content with their present successes."

This debate has been a private one for a number of reasons, chiefly due to the consequences of the government discussing revolutionary tendencies, let alone adopting them. Still, it is a discussion that our party must have, so that we may be sure to confidently walk our chosen road.\n\nWhile this reformist approach has been criticised by some within our ranks, it has enabled us to now form a government and make at least some changes to India. Winning the election has created a more pro-reform feeling within the party. Some now feel that it might be possible to transform India into a socialist nation over the course of many years. However, we are very much limited by the very system that brought us to power. There are limits to what reforms we can realistically make without making near-impossible changes to the constitution and several other pillars of Indian society.\n\nRevolution is therefore a rather attractive option in the minds of many socialists. We would be able to swiftly and freely do away with all that oppresses the Indian worker and peasant in the course of only a year or two. We are, after all, the government of India, and therefore in a good position to provide the proletariat of our nation with the support it needs to triumph in the revolution. Still, there is always the risk that said revolution fail, plunging India into a period of great darkness and suppression. the debate carries on, passionately yet quietly.

With such a great deal of support, most MPs simply wished to voice their criticisms of the dying government for the final time. Prime Minister Desai made an understated yet impassioned plea to the Lok Sabha that the issues within his administration and party could be resolved. It was a solid defense and while it might have sparked some amount of sympathy, it came far too late to truly affect the vote. the motion of no confidence passed with an overwhelming majority in favour of it. Desai was now no longer Prime Minister, his government having fallen victim to the infighting within the Janata Party. Elections would soon begin to determine his successor. the cycle of politics would begin anew.\n\nThe Hawkish Faction of the Janata party were pleased to see their motion pass. Even if they were no longer to be part of a governing party, the crisis within Janata would give them plenty of influence to exert. Desai, should he remain as party leader, would have no choice but to accept their demands. Were a leadership race to instead commence, the hawks would potentially be able to wrest control of the party for themselves. the battle for Janata paled in comparison to the prospect of a new election however, and so they were left to their own battle, having become yesterday's political scandal."

Having learned a great deal, Desai now approached them from a much stronger position. He argued that the only path forward would be a mutually-beneficial one. the Janata party would agree to harden then stances on criminal justice and take a more active role in the battle against Azad Hind. In return, the hawks would have simply to prove their loyalty by keeping schtum for while. Hidayatullah protested, declaring that more would required of Desai for a deal to be reached . the Party Leader was not to be swayed however. There would be no Janata party if the infighting continued. Votes would be siphoned off to the INC, Swatantra and BJS until the Conservative party was no more. the back-and-forth would continue for several hours, as an agreement was slowly written up.

Golwakar made a speech declaring that the Prime Minister "seems to care more for heathens in far-off Karachi than loyal Hindus here in Delhi or Jaipur". Golwakar's rally would go on for several more hours, until the politicians leaving for the day would have him and his followers dispersed by a police contingent. If they had hoped to be rid of him, they were going to be deeply disappointed. Calling upon his followers, Golwakar would leave a series of loud and aggressive marches through a number of cities across the country.\n\nOne day he would be in Delhi, the next in Bombay. Wherever he went, a band of furious RSS members followed him. To his admirers, he seemed dedicated and inspiring. To his detractors, he was a rather loud nuisance. Despite his calls to repeal the granted autonomy, Golwakar's cries fell on deaf ears in the government. Indeed, he was ignored."

Many muslims living in the border regions felt that they would find a brighter and perhaps most of all, accepting future in Pakistan, seeing as it was a clearly muslim majority are. With the option to migrate now readily available, thousands immediately took the chance. As these first immigrants traveled smoothly across the border, they were joined by more and more people. After a couple of days of increasingly busy checkpoints, the queues to enter Pakistan were becoming dramatically longer. Soon, many of the immigrants were being forced to camp out in the winding paths. Of course, not all were content to wait so patiently. It was quite impossible to keep a check on everyone trying to cross, and as such, many crossed quite illegally. In some cases, many crossed without even coming close to a checkpoint. This was in fact down to poor communication regarding proper crossing procedure. Few had actually meant to cross illegally.\n\nWith the situation not improving, the prime minister was forced to create a number of makeshift checkpoints. These helped to ease the streams of people, but it would take to fully return to normal. While border authorities were managing this chaotic situation, officials in Pakistan and Delhi were celebrating the success of their reforms. Indeed, when thousands, soon to be millions of people are flocking to experience life across the border, one can hardly call the reforms a failure. Now all that was left to do was find those that had managed to cross illegally by accident, and fire whoever forgot to give them the memo..."

With little investment from either private or government sources, modernising the region became ironically rather more expensive as a result. For many years, money had been slowly funneled into fixing this error. Of course, the sheer reluctance to truly commit to investing in the region was another piece in the problem. Although, they would never admit it, most of the Lok Sabha would feel a great sense of relief now that never had to manage the issue again.\n\nFrom now on, Pakistan would be handled by local politicians in Karachi. As soon as they were able, they got to work on bringing the autonomous zone up to speed. With someone else handling Pakistan, the Lok Sabha was finally able to divert the funding towards other projects. the regional government were more than up to the task, and set about building up a great deal of the underdeveloped or nonexistent infrasutruce across their territories.

It had been a long and tiresome process. Many had found starting a new life in the autonomous region to have been together than expected but there was still an air of excitement among the people of Pakistan. For a great deal of pakistanis, autonomy was a chance to make their home somewhere that respected their traditions and beliefs, somewhere where people that respects their voices would represent them. For those that had immigrated from the Hindu majority regions, it was a chance to escape the persecution they often faced in the rest of India. These religious troubles had seemed like an almost unavoidable problem for many years, with no clear end it sight. With the mass-migration across the borders however, a chance for at least some peace was making itself clearer. Across the western regions of India, the far too common reports of religious violence were starting to become less and less common. For the authorities in these regions, mostly police and fire brigades, who had to deal with the arsonry that accompanied the religious clashes. It was not as if the problems were entirely gone. Indeed, it seemed that persecution was going to be a constant issue. Instead, it was merely that with the mass migration, there were fewer "others", "outsiders" or "heathens" to come into contact with. Still, it looked good on paper for all officials involved and that was enough, especially since it was still an improvement."

Of course, this needed a vast number of administrative offices both in Karachi and in the rest of India, to insure that the free trade policy of the Administrative District Council wasn't being abused or exploited in other parts of the country. These offices would of course need to be quickly constructed and workers would be needed for their complex operations. Then there was the paperwork. In order for a company to participate in the autonomous economic zone, they would need to fill out some rather heavy piles of forms and applications. Indeed, setting up the zone was going to be rather pricey.\n\nOnce the buildings were done, the technicalities neatly sorted out and the businesses established, Karachi would finally open. Expectations were high, as the zone was predicted to bring in quite a bit cash. It was in fact expected to cover its own costs within the first year alone. the matter was finalized with the handover of the city of Karachi to the new government of the Islamic Administrative District Council. They were happy to be in charge of such a lucrative business, after all."

We hope that a more socialist-focused education will help to counteract some of the side effects of heavily saffronised Indian school system, which has proved to a be a continuous problem for our government. By providing schools with alternatives to the figures held in high regards by conservatives and nationalists, we can provide a more secular and international curriculum that will hopefully ease tensions among the various groups that make up Indian society. There are three options for us to choose from. the first is to truly glorify socialism, from the texts of Marx to the Soviet Union. We will focus on the positives and ignore the rest. the curriculum will make it so that all know the endless triumphs of socialism across the world. the second is to simply tell the honest truth, or as close as we can come to it as such. We shall not use any propaganda and simply stick to the available facts, after all, we must prove ourselves as proper socialists and that we do not rely on the past for support. the third option is a balance between the previous two, we will use a small amount of propaganda to bolster our standing, without risking to seem biased or outright untruthful. After all, we can only interpret historical events, who know what happened in those bygone days? Hopefully this gives Socialism just a boost in popularity, without upsetting anyone. It is fair to say that all these options carry risk. If we go too far, we may anger the population but if we do nothing, we will still have to deal with current opinion on socialism among a large part of the population. Should we try to use the path of moderation, it may not go far enough. Despite all this, a decision has to be made and we must then commit to it, should we want it to succeed."

Although most simply went ahead with the proposed plan, seeing it as ultimately up to the teachers themselves to present the government's ideas, there were a sizeable amount of opposition to it all. Many teachers protested openly, calling the government's new curriculum "propaganda of the worst kind", pointing out the numerous historical facts and events that had either been ignored or altered slightly to better present socialism throughout the years. Many usual supporters of the government have even expressed their disappointment at their actions, firstly because of the absolute and deliberate disregard of history and secondly because of the hopes they had for a new party finally getting into power. Many saw the government plan as a failed measure to counteract the so called saffronisation of Indian schools, a name for sometimes nationalistic hindu tendency that certain school books often featured. the plan has been a disaster for the socialists, having utterly backfired in the attempt.

This was outrages for many, but the Prime Minister was not finished. His government would work to end the caste system too, and put a stop to the "artificial, antiquated and superstitious rules that keep India divided". With this proclamation, riots erupted across the country, as traditionalists expressed their fury at what they perceived as a direct attack on their way of life. Conservative protesters displayed a number of striking banners a one rally, depicting the Prime Minister as demon being slain by figures from Hindu legend. Clashes with the police were not uncommon sights in the big cities and many prominent government officials had to escorted by security personnel.the initial reaction from the government was to ignore these rioters, hoping that they would die down. Some voices from within the party were at this point calling for negotiations to take place, hoping that a more moderate and cooperative approach would yield a better result and put an end to the violence. the Prime Minister held the line however, determined that they would not surrender yet.\n\nLess then a day later after the Prime Minister's announcement, a rioter in new Delhi managed to burn down the house of a cabinet member. While he suffered from minor burns, he and his family escaped the fire and it was quickly put out. At this point, the Prime Minister had had his hand forced. the extent of the reforms were quickly scaled back and somewhat sincere apology was made to smooth over the damage done.

Unfortunately, the Prime Minister was among them. the new junta has revealed that they were only attempting to arrest the Prime Minister to bring them to a legal trial, but that the leader of the nation committed suicide with an assault rifle before they could be taken. While most doubt this story, the junta has agreed to submit the body to an international team of forensics specialists for confirmation.\n\nWith the old government gone, the new leader of the nation is Gopal Gurunath Bewoor. Bewoor has not officially taken the title of Prime Minister yet, though many expect him to. He claims he wishes only to reign for a transitional period before true democracy can be restored, cleansed of the corruption and tyranny of the socialists. This is another claim most scoff at, but after the complete misrule in the latter part of socialist governance, the nation seems to be reluctantly accepting their new dictator with the hope that he may just keep his word.\n\nThat's not to say that Bewoor's transition into leadership has been easy. With much of the government arrested or in protest of this violation of democracy, he must act very carefully to reach his goals, whatever they may be. To take the civil post of Prime Minister and place other junta members in cabinet positions could help solidify legitimacy and restore some normalcy, though it could also be seen as a further violation of democracy.

After this, many in the junta were granted official positions, solidifying them as leaders rather than as generals and commanders in a sort of government limbo, having power but no title or official channels to wield it.\n\nThere are some signs of unrest within the leadership, however. With the restoration of government and the political order, so too has come the restoration of the machiavellian plots and scheming typical of the high government. It is much worse than usual given that the politicians are also ruthless military men and that the precedent of coup has already been set, setting the scene for power jockeying on a greater scale than usual.

Bewoor has given several statements and speeches on his logic, but perhaps the most famous quote so far came in a speech on the steps of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, in which he said this: "I love democracy. I love India. Everything I have done has been for the protection of democracy, not as an act against it. Democracy can only really exist in a truly democratic framework, a framework that democracy paradoxically cannot itself establish. As regrettable as it is, the corruption and tyranny of the socialists has proven that democracy is vulnerable when not given a proper period to establish. Mark my words, I will establish democracy in India, but the transitional period is necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the democratic process."\n\nThis has proven wildly controversial not just among the general public and the international community but also Bewoor's own junta. the more ideologically minded within it, who actually participated in the coup to at least attempt to save democracy, see this as a betrayal and an overreach. More importantly, the more power-minded majority are outraged that their influence has been taken away, and that their participation in the coup has been repaid by betrayal.

Ghosh, who also had plans to kill the Mahaan Pundit and aggressively expand Indian influence into China, was found guilty within the first day of his trial, and sentenced to execution by firing squad.\n\nWhile there are still criminals in the world, and in India, it is with great pleasure that we know at least one will no longer be a threat."

 india.317.desc:0 "Mahaan Pundit Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar, better known as Guruji, has taken to the radio waves to stir up support. His words, ever wise and inspiring, entered the home of every Indian who owned a radio, his brilliant rhetoric stirring their hearts and minds. He spoke of faith and nation and unity, and he encouraged all Indians to serve the new state with everything they had. He has given his full endorsement to our government, and those wary that he would support an RSS takeover or worse still take direct control himself have been proven wrong.\n\nThe Mahaan Pundit's words could not have come at a better time. He is one of the most influential men in all of India among the common folk, his words being what brought a great many to our side in the first place. Now, as his voice flows across the country and sings our praises, he has cemented himself as a loyal member of the new order rather than a thorn in our side, at least for now. Let all Indians listen to the airwaves, for the gods let the Mahaan Pundit sing upon them."

 india.322.desc:0 "In a speech today by A, a well-known journalist and the husband of Savitri Devi, he openly addressed the problem of convincing Indian people to join us. Fascism, thanks to the Japanese Yokusankai, still carries the reputation of being pro-Japanese, and the legacy of the last war still makes people uncomfortable. the solution, therefore, is to avoid usage of terms such as "fascism" and distribute openly anti-Japanese propaganda in order to show the people that we are different. His speech is clearly influenced by his forcible removal from the Azad Hind, but he's not entirely wrong."

 india.323.desc:0 "Thivy has finally revealed his bold new plan to revitalize and rebuild the Indian economy. the first of many five-year plans, Thivy's proposal is made up of three main steps, which he calls "rebuilding, resettling, and recovery". Rebuilding is simple but massive: fund a huge construction effort that will repair the infrastructure and even civilian property damaged in the civil war, with a major focus on small towns and rural areas. Resettling means bringing all those who were displaced from the towns and forced into cities back to their homes in the countryside, and perhaps even giving our lost and poor free or cheap homes in the villages to build the rural population. Finally, there is recovery: the rebuilt and resettled townspeople will bolster our agriculture immensely, ensuring that every Indian will be fed. While some complain that the plan not only distracts from industrialization but actively harms it, Thivy argues that our population has to be fed first. Once this plan is completed and our food supplies are secured, our future five-year plans can focus entirely on factories and industry without us having to worry constantly about agriculture."

Each caste has a purpose, and each one will serve the new India well. As it has always been, each caste will be perfectly suited to its role, a just and efficient way of running society indeed.\n\nThe Brahmin caste will see a new golden age, as they will be the voices of the gods in our nation. Hinduism is the most important aspect of our ideology, and so they shall spread and enforce spirituality among the masses. the Kshatriya will enforce our will on Earth, the leaders and generals of our great nation. Below them, the Vaishya will do as they have always done, trading and doing business and keeping our economy strong. They owe us a great collective debt for our destruction of the communists who threatened their work. the lifeblood of our country, the Sudra, will get to live in this new golden age, and they shall feel pride knowing that their labor contributes to the greater good of the new India. Even the Dalit will redeem themselves, and though their lives shall be hard they will certainly rest well knowing that India as a whole benefits from their hard work."

Not a single one tripped or even wiped the sweat off their forehead, exemplars of perfect discipline. They accompanied our mighty arsenal of tanks and vehicles, of which only a small fraction was on display. These beasts crawled across the hard surface of the road, roaring with the might of India for all our citizens to see. More than once, we had several of our planes streak overhead while flying fairly low for all to hear and see, a personal touch to demonstrate our dominance of both earth and sky. the massive crowd watched from the ground, yelling and cheering for our boys as they demonstrated power and control. From a viewing area erected high above the rest, our most important officials and leaders viewed the parade with restraint, occasionally giving official-looking waves and salutes as certain parts passed by.\n\nThis great show of our new nation's army signifies that Fascism is now the one truth held by all of India. We struggled greatly to make it so, and with our victory we have joined the ranks of countless nations across the world who have thrown off the chains of the old and embraced the new order. We are not afraid to shout and show the world that India is one nation, united in purpose, stronger than any other! Vande Mataram!"

Can the true India and Azad Hind finally put aside their differences for the sake of the people!\n\nNO! the traitors will never be forgiven! Bose abandoned India when he bowed to the Japanese, and his false nation will never be recognized! Soldiers man the walls separating the two governments and give out orders loud and clear: disperse, for we have no place for you here!

It is, in essence, a combination of the two proposals, attempting to bring the two sides together. It proposes an economy rooted within agriculture and farmland, and rejects what he has called "western consumerism" and industrialization. At the same time, however, the economy would be directed towards military efforts, not just in production of equipment, but in instilling proper values in the soldiers and labourers who do everything for the fatherland. It isn't exactly clear how an economy based on farming and produce can sustain a capable and efficient army, but if anyone can make it happen, it's the Mahaan Pundit. Without him, our movement would be nothing!"

There was much basking in the glory of our victory and what we've accomplished so far, but the meeting inevitably took a darker turn when we actually started to discuss the issues ahead. Foreign policy, internal unrest, establishing ourselves internationally, these would all be great obstacles to overcome.\n\nThe greatest priority on everyone's mind was inevitably our neighbors. the traitors in Pakistan and Sri Lanka stabbed us in the back just as we were at our lowest, and we will not forgive that soon. We also have to deal with Bose's false government in the east and the ever-present threat of Japan, the specter that has haunted Asia ever since the world war ended. There was much debate over whether we should try to appeal to Japan as equals or simply end the charade and march into our rightful land guns blazing, with little progress made in the debate on either side. We eventually moved on to internal struggles.\n\nThe war devastated the subcontinent, with many left starving, homeless, or both. Furthermore, even after our complete victory there remain those who are defiant and would throw India into anarchy once more in the name of their ideology. the hurt and starving are an issue for right now, but it is inevitable that some of these ideological zealots will try to organize and attack us once again. Where and how is hard to know, making them an issue to be dealt with later.\n\nThe meeting adjourned with a general sense of wary accomplishment. Though we will face many more challenges in the coming years and decades, we are still secure in our victory, and we are the ones who will lead India rather than the traitors and weaklings. Under our guidance, India shall always prevail."

What still stands is pockmarked by bullets, scars of a long and deadly gunfight. the old man has been homeless ever since the conflict, his shelter destroyed in the ideological flames of civil war. His son fought for the communists and was shot, while his two daughters both fled far away without him.\n\nHis story is not uncommon among the people of India today, and there are perhaps millions who are without food or homes or have lost their loved ones. Even worse, there are still zealots and traitors who plot to throw the country into chaos once more in the name of their fanaticism. We cannot allow our people to suffer this way. For all the struggles we have gone through in the past, these are the struggles of today, and as the people's state it is our duty to alleviate their suffering and do all we can for them. If we are left in this state forever, we will be weak and easy prey for any who would attack us."

People across the nation cheer on the BJS, as we are who they fought to have victorious in the vicious civil war. They have been loyal to us through all our conflicts, and now we finally have a chance to truly serve them rather than maneuver and dance around in these endless political conflicts.\n\nMany local Shakhas of the RSS are either disbanding or retooling to be local branches of the BJS directly. Party membership is skyrocketing as citizens all sign up to be a part of the grand new future of India. Even the Mahaan Pundit has embraced our government and urged his followers to give us their full support, though we are always going to have to keep one eye open when it comes to Golwalkar.

Some will be dealt with swiftly and covertly, while some of the higher-ranking ones will have to be given trials.

Unlike the RSS, the new force has very little autonomy, and rather than being a patchwork of militias it is a strong and centralized fighting force completely dedicated to the cause of the BJS. They will never develop their own ideology like the RSS did, for they will be completely and utterly inseparable from the party. Most importantly, their leadership will have much overlap with and be entirely dependent on the BJS, ensuring that they will stay linked with us and not drift away over time as the RSS did.

Many positions have been removed, replaced, or shuffled around to create a streamlined route for the state to grasp the big picture easily while still allowing micromanagement and supervision at every level. the bureaucracy has been completely reformed and drained of corruption. All offices have been filled by loyal party members, and those who question us and our state have no place in the new administration.

After a long propaganda campaign emphasizing the unity of the Indian people, we can move forwards on the further expansion of state control.

In order to prevent this, and achieve our goals of the unity of the state and its people, the Party Membership Act has been drafted and put into effect. the act makes party membership mandatory of all citizens. Children will join party youth groups and participate in group building activities, adults will meet regularly in select areas to have meetings with local party officials, and membership in any other political party is banned.

We are going to have to be a bit less discriminatory from here on out. Anyone who only has circumstantial evidence against them is clearly just better at hiding the evidence!

Some would say that to uphold the will of the nation is different than upholding the will of the state, and that may be true in corrupt governments that parade around their false 'democracy', but the government of the new India knows better. the nation and the state are one and the same in every aspect, inseparably held together by faith and our people. In turn, both are completely linked with the party, which wisely guides India forwards. Thus, if the judiciary serves the state and the state serves the party, then we must reach the logical conclusion that the judiciary serves the party. Thus, the system has been reformed so that the decision of a judge will never be different than the decision of the inner circle, and that any judge who goes rogue can be swiftly dealt with and his false verdict overturned.

All these really served to do in the new state was to hinder our will and make us less effective as we guide India forwards. No more! We have finally rebuilt our government from the ground up. This is not a pathetic remnant system from the British, rife with corruption and inefficiency. the new government is a perfectly constructed machine that will serve our purposes without hesitation.

This, combined with the increased decadence of the Raj, followed by the horrible period of secular rule under the Republic, has made those truly dedicated to Hindu values scorned and angered. Now, with our authority cemented, we can start working towards a Hinduism backed by the full power of the state.

But our ascension to power has given us the tools we need to make Hindutva a reality. For now one, Hinduism shall be the state religion, and all other "faiths" will be banned. the practitioners of these faiths will be re-educated at a later date, and the places of worship will be shut down and replaced with Hindu shrines, temples and other sacred places.

This bill, described by the Mahaan Pundit as "Welfare for Hindus" is an act that shall ensure that those loyal to the state and the gods who may be in unfortunate economic conditions will be guaranteed health care and money so that they may pay for basic goods.

Though they may have failed in this life, the knowledge that we can install in them is valuable and can ensure that they may prosper in the next life. This effort has seen the beginning of a brighter future, when a news story today featured numerous former Muslims from the outskirts of Delhi speaking about their transformation. Being the second largest religion in India, destroying Islamic sovereignty over our nation has been of primary importance, so the sight of numerous former practitioners recounting the kind people at numerous "religious education academies" throughout the country is a solid sight, and has shown those pro-muslim groups who still work in the country that they shall never win."

If farmers are given completely free reign, they will understandably focus on trying to make a profit and grow more cash-oriented crops. While this is no surprise, it still means that many Indians go without food because not enough is grown for them. No more. Our new reforms specifically restrict what can be grown and where to grow it.

What about those who do not have such devotion? the Muslims, who follow an invader's faith and created the traitor state of Pakistan? the communists and socialists, who slaughtered their own brethren in the name of a broken and twisted ideology?

It won't be easy, of course; Japanese assistance and a complex array of bunkers will make any attempt at unification difficult.

Afghanistan seized our territory when we fought so desperately against the Japanese, and for too long they have sat upon their mountain throne fearing nothing. Now, we will repay them in turn.

They were forced to retreat, leaving a weakened but hungry-for-revenge rival. With our new partnerships, however, that rivalry has become a tad more subdued. Rather than fortifying borders and building guns, the two powers now use a more gentle hand, vying for influence with honeyed words and tempting deals. the battle has gone from a shouting match to a quiet game of chess, each player thinking long and hard before making carefully calculated moves.

Now, there is a duality in Asia: the titanic Japanese and their sprawling Co-Prosperity sphere, and that which they could not defeat, the giant of India. While the Japanese are on top right now, they have finally come to acknowledge our strength and influence and have opted to work with us rather than embark on a doomed quest to subdue us.

Across the country, the government is recruiting the best and brightest straight from the most prestigious universities and institutes, and we begin our push for a strong, advanced, and modern military.

India's officer corps were for the longest time composed of an old guard that had served against the Japanese during the struggle for independence, and not until the civil war was there a chance for a new generation of commanders to gain true military experience and reach the standards of their peers. Now, the new Indian government sees the need for well-trained officers, recruited from the brightest of the nation.\n\nThe new officer school is a state-of-the-art institute, owned and run entirely by the state. It is the perfect system, designed so that the best generals of the nation can pass down their knowledge to a new generation of strategists and tacticians. It is attended by the most loyal and eager minds that the country can offer, each and every one ready to put their brains to use to bring India to victory. Some of India's greatest generals teach there, showing these young tacticians both the grand strategy and minute details of warfare.

An economy run by the state would guarantee stability and predictability rather than the wild fluctuations of a market let loose that so often bring suffering to the common man. the state's kind hand will ensure that the worker and the businessman alike shall know stability and predictability, and that every commoner and peasant who is loyal and deserving shall have work and a wage. the people of India will thank us."

That is why the state has finally intervened and begun to take full control over the economy of the nation. Industries are nationalized, businesses confiscated and redistributed, and many workers now find themselves getting their paycheck from a kind and stable government rather than a greedy elitist. Furthermore, with every factor in its control, the state can plan out complex interactions and set the path of the economy for years and months to come.

In order to do that, we are rewriting the curriculum for up and coming officers from scratch. They will learn from the German, American, Japanese and Italian schools of combat, and learn to take all these lessons into account when they go out to defend the fatherland.

These loyal young men and women learn valuable skills and get the chance to do great service for their country, which is all any young person could ask for.

Oil, metals, gems, and more shall be under its jurisdiction, and it is hoped that it will do much to fix the old and inefficient systems that were based on bringing wealth to the elites and exploiting the common Indian.

Therefore, in order to solve this, as apart of our other economic initiatives, we will make sure that wages will increase. For now on, wage controls have been set on factory work to be much higher than before. This will mean that not only will these workers have more money to spend, thus boosting our economy, this can also help with our continued problem of poverty and how to solve it. Some will say that this is communism and that we mustn't do this, but we don't have many options. Either we do this now, or continue to suffer from a weak economy and an impoverished people."

Hospitals and clinics have been seized and reorganized by the loving hand of the state, and doctors and nurses now provide care not for greed and money but for the safety of the people and the glory of the nation. It is both heartwarming and tragic to see hundreds pour into hospitals, finally able to get treatment for their wounds that they were denied under the previous government. Never again shall Indians have to fear death from diseases that all modern countries regard as minor.

India's infrastructure is seen as crumbling and third-rate, and that has only been made exponentially worse by the ravages of war. Many if not most towns have only dirt roads, and those are barely maintained and hardly usable. India must be united by rail and road if it is to be united as a people. New railways, better trains, paved roads, these are the things India so desperately needed! As train stations open in places once isolated from the rest of the nation and the world, Indians can finally seek opportunities and commune with their peers across the country. Goods can be transported more easily and food goes quicker from farm to table. To take advantage of the new infrastructure, the act also includes provisions for increasing the output of farms and mines, meaning that the new roads will always have drivers on them. the government too has been expanded simply to accommodate all this. This is one of the most extensive expansion acts in history, and it is truly showing its effectiveness."

All universities will have their curriculum turned towards training students in either practical labour and job skills, or in learning party values and ideas. This will create an educated workforce that can compete for higher level jobs and generate more wealth in the economy. Along with that, it destroys anti-Hindu ideas and promotes ideological unity within the working class. Two birds with one stone!"

However, now that the civil war is over, those militias are quickly seeming less and less satisfactory. It is becoming increasingly clear that a reformation and expansion of the army is necessary - the real question, then, is how should we go about doing it? Two potential avenues lie before us: we could integrate the militias into our army doctrine, focusing on guerrilla tactics and utilization of our surroundings' exceedingly irregular terrain, or we could reorganize and reform the militias entirely, focusing on a well-trained and well-equipped army and overwhelming the enemy with firepower rather than manpower. Whichever path we choose, we really should choose one soon."

All these forces need to remain effective is a change of equipment - and perhaps a change of tactics, training, organisation, and a few other things. But we will make that change!\n\nTo this end, we shall make sweeping changes to the militias, improving their weaponry, their command structure, and their understanding of warfare. Soon, the militias will transform from hastily formed brigades into a defense force more than capable of protecting the nation, and each man shall be proud to say he is a member of the People's Army!"

That being said, the civil war is over, and while our old fighting forces managed to triumph over other hastily assembled ideological armies, it's almost inconceivable that they could repeat that victory over a standardised and regular foreign military. As a result, it is necessary for us to rein the militias in as a part of our army, to create - well, a standardised and regular military.\n\nOf course, we're not just going to forget the triumphs of the militias; the tactics that allowed them to succeed are a natural place in our new army. They have shown that victory on this continent does not come about from sheer discipline or firepower, but from utilising the rugged terrain and engaging in guerrilla warfare.

While this will be a considerable investment of time and resources, our top Marxist scholars promise that this application of dialectical materialism to the military will ensure the revolutionary forces shall thoroughly devastate the forces of counter-revolution."

On their advice, we have formed a large and comprehensive Armored Corps that integrates our tanks, self-propelled artillery, and similar units into a single army component rather than spaced across divisions in order to promote more specialized unit training and tactics among our armored units."

In it, he praised the Marxist dialectical innovations produced by our general staff and articulated the vision behind the IPA to the broader public for the first time. the essence of the military doctrine behind the IPA is that as history has marched ever further towards smaller, professional, and well-equipped armies as the premier military force on the global stage, we have no choice but to follow it if we wish to defend and advance the revolution successfully. It is backwards and foolhardy to vomit hordes of guerillas into jungles as in the days of the civil war, militiamen equipped with khakis and bolt action rifles who knew nothing more than how to fog a mirror and pull a trigger.\n\nBetter to put the proletariat to work stoking the fires of industry across our nation to produce high quality military equipment for the finest physical specimens our military can recruit. He declared complete confidence in the belief that elite, centrally commanded forces are the only path that leads to revolutionary victory. Keeping in mind the disaster of an un-industrialized Soviet Union and its poorly coordinated and under-equipped militias succumbing to the advance of an effective modern military machine commanded from Berlin, it's doubtful that anyone could say otherwise."

While we have indeed integrated our militia groups into the army, it is beyond question that they cannot thrive under the yoke of "general staffs" or "central commands". Militias are bands of brothers; their bonds were forged in blood shed for the revolution. This revolution was not fought to shackle soldiers to officers but free every man from every oppression.\n\nTherefore, we have today completed the development of a doctrine of decentralized unit tactics; militia units shall each operate independent of the army chain of command as autonomous military units to allow freedom and flexibility in carrying out their operations. This autonomy will instill in militia units a renewed drive to victory in battle and inspire ever more fervent revolutionary fervor within their individual minds.

Good news: These are excellent conditions in which to wage guerrilla warfare. And our militiamen wrought havoc on the enemy through warfare in precisely those conditions. Whether defending our home from counter-revolutionary incursion, or infiltrating deep into enemy territory as a strike force, Our militiamen need to be able to keep their guerilla training and tactics strong, and our army has just the idea...\n\nToday, Chairman Majumdar signed a memorandum to all regional and municipal leaders stating that they and their people are to permit the militiamen full use of their farms, homes, and cities for guerilla training. Citizens are to stay out of the way as militiamen conduct urban house-to-house combat drills, and peasants should remain calm and try to stay out of their line of fire as they stealthily move through their wheat and cotton fields, popping up to take potshots at OPFOR training units. Some minor protest this has been reported but, frankly, Chairman Majumdar believes the proletariat should be grateful for all the good the militias have done for them. We owe our socialist paradise to them, and we must make necessary accommodations for their continued success."

Some simplification of the militia system was clearly necessary...\n\nToday Chairman Majumdar, flanked by camo-fatigued militia bosses, gave a landmark speech inaugurating the new branch of the Indian Peoples military, the Revolutionary Guard. the Revolutionary Guard shall act as a loose amalgamation of autonomous militia units democratically deciding their structure and operations. They shall be responsible for procurement, recruitment, training, and operations, and the people of India shall be expected to assist them with their mission in any way feasible\n\nThe Revolutionary Guard militias have been crucial to our victory, and they are the vanguard who shall lead the way in the realization of our great socialist dream. Filled with zeal for Chairman Majumdar and the Marxist doctrine, they shall guide the people towards the light of communism, surely the people will be grateful for their leadership and grant their requests. However strange or demanding the Revolutionary Guards might be towards the people, Chairman Majumdar expects that they shall all trust in the torchbearers of the Revolution."

If this unit existed, which it doesn't, it would not be used for deniable subversive revolutionary activities at home and abroad. It would definitely operate under full purview of the army command structure and our national laws and would not be personally answerable to Chairman Majumdar himself. We are not using this unit, which, as a reminder, does not exist, to carry out intelligence operations or political assassinations.

 india.441.t:0 "Industrial Improvements"
 india.441.desc:0 "To describe the Indian economy as "backward" is rather harsh but in terms of the Marxist dialectic, it's absolutely correct. Despite the socialist triumph in the Civil War, our economy is still a largely destitute and agricultural one... which somehow still can't reliably feed the country. We are presently wallowing deep in the mud of the feudal stage, the third stage, of economic development and have yet to even reach the fourth stage of capitalism, a crucial prerequisite to realizing communism. This simply must be rectified.\n\nThankfully we have today commenced a series of industrial improvements aimed at accelerating the development of our state through the capitalist stage. the party is supervising the establishment of light and heavy industrial concerns that shall employ the countless urban poor, as well as further the mechanization of our agriculture. Some left-deviationists have condemned our party's new economic blueprinting as "state capitalism", but Chairman Majumdar has no need to listen to those naysayers now that proper Marxists run the government."
 india.441.a:0 "Communism shall be built here, among these bright angelic mills."

 india.442.t:0 "The Proletarian State Initiative"
 india.442.desc:0 "In communist symbology, the hammer and sickle are overlaid over one another in equal proportions. This symbolizes the union of the peasantry, the sickle, and the proletariat, the hammer, as equal partners in the revolutionary struggle towards communism.\n\nHowever, it is the official position of Indian Marxism that one partner is more equal than the other.\n\nToday Chairman Majumdar gave a speech to the Indian Peoples Assembly announcing the development of his new economic program, which he has dubbed "The Proletarian State Initiative". the aim of this program, building on our industrial improvements, is to encourage the education and assistance of the Indian peasantry towards becoming members of the industrial proletariat. Our rural, agricultural economy is an impediment to dialectical economic progress, and the dumb yokel peasantry have traditionally been prime grounds for reactionary, religious, and feudal ideology to fester. For communism to be truly realized in India, the immortal Marxist science of history must be followed to a tee, and we must economically transition to a state of the proletariat, a people far more amenable to socialist modes of production.\n\This shall be accomplished through a three-pronged attack on the holdovers of our feudal age: State control of industry to concentrate it around urban locales, extensive welfare for the proletariat to entice the peasantry to join them, and free education for all with strict Marxist ideological instruction.\n\n"The Revolution did not end with martial victory, but shall continue until we have achieved total economic and cultural victory!" concluded Chairman Majumdar. His address was met with thunderous applause."

However, now that the civil war is over, those militias are quickly seeming less and less satisfactory. It is becoming increasingly clear that a reformation and expansion of the army is necessary - the real question, then, is how should we go about doing it? Two potential avenues lie before us: we could integrate the militias into our army doctrine, focusing on guerrilla tactics and utilization of our surroundings' exceedingly irregular terrain, or we could reorganize and reform the militias entirely, focusing on a well-trained and well-equipped army and overwhelming the enemy with firepower rather than manpower. Whichever path we choose, we really should choose one soon."
 india.496.a:0 "Perhaps it could do with a few changes."

 india.497.t:0 "Reorganisation of Militia"
 india.497.desc:0 "Without the militias to support us, our valiant struggle would have almost certainly faltered against the oppressive might of the capitalist and fascist regimes. Obviously then, the correct course of action for our military is not to get rid of the militias, but rather to... improve them. All these forces need to remain effective is a change of equipment - and perhaps a change of tactics, training, organisation, and a few other things. But we will make that change!\n\nTo this end, we shall make sweeping changes to the militias, improving their weaponry, their command structure, and their understanding of warfare. Soon, the militias will transform from hastily formed brigades into a defense force more than capable of protecting the nation, and each man shall be proud to say he is a member of the People's Army!"

 india.498.t:0 "Integration of Militia"
 india.498.desc:0 "Without the militias to support us, our valiant struggle would have almost certainly faltered against the oppressive might of the capitalist and fascist regimes. That being said, the civil war is over, and while our old fighting forces managed to triumph over other hastily assembled ideological armies, it's almost inconceivable that they could repeat that victory over a standardised and regular foreign military. As a result, it is necessary for us to rein the militias in as a part of our army, to create - well, a standardised and regular military.\n\nOf course, we're not just going to forget the triumphs of the militias; the tactics that allowed them to succeed are a natural place in our new army. They have shown that victory on this continent does not come about from sheer discipline or firepower, but from utilising the rugged terrain and engaging in guerrilla warfare. With this new integration, the old militias will still be using these strategies - it's just that they'll be handled by us from now on."

A rebel army needs driven guerrillas to wage an uprising, but a socialist state needs a professional and centralized military to subdue threats both domestic and international. Today we have taken a critical step in the creation of a modern fighting force with the formation of a Central Command structure. the officers of our general staff shall coordinate across the various branches of the Indian People's Armed Forces, delivering a top-down chain of command to direct the totality of our forces across multiple operations.

While this will be a considerable investment of time and resources, our top Raoist scholars promise that this application of dialectical materialism to the military will ensure the revolutionary forces shall thoroughly devastate the forces of counter-revolution."

On their advice, we have formed a large and comprehensive Armored Corps that integrates our tanks, self-propelled artillery, and similar units into a single army component rather than spaced across divisions in order to promote more specialized unit training and tactics among our armored units."

Comrade Sundarayya, flanked on both sides by our top generals, has given a landmark speech today inaugurating the IPA. In it, he praised the Raoist dialectical innovations produced by our general staff and articulated the vision behind the IPA to the broader public for the first time. the essence of the military doctrine behind the IPA is that as history has marched ever further towards smaller, professional, and well-equipped armies as the premier military force on the global stage, we have no choice but to follow it if we wish to defend and advance the revolution successfully. It is backwards and foolhardy to vomit hordes of guerillas into jungles as in the days of the civil war, militiamen equipped with khakis and bolt action rifles who knew nothing more than how to fog a mirror and pull a trigger.\n\nBetter to put the proletariat to work stoking the fires of industry across our nation to produce high quality military equipment for the finest physical specimens our military can recruit. He declared complete confidence in the belief that elite, centrally commanded forces are the only path that leads to revolutionary victory. Keeping in mind the disaster of an un-industrialized Soviet Union and its poorly coordinated and under-equipped militias succumbing to the advance of an effective modern military machine commanded from Berlin, it's doubtful that anyone could say otherwise."

 india.4009.desc:0 "Bad news: the subcontinent is severely underdeveloped, our proletariat either living in sparse jungles or mountains or cramped together in utter urban squalor. Good news: These are excellent conditions in which to wage guerrilla warfare. And our militiamen wrought havoc on the enemy through warfare in precisely those conditions. Whether defending our home from counter-revolutionary incursion, or infiltrating deep into enemy territory as a strike force, Our militiamen need to be able to keep their guerilla training and tactics strong, and our army has just the idea...\n\nToday, Comrade Sundarayya signed a memorandum to all regional and municipal leaders stating that they and their people are to permit the militiamen full use of their farms, homes, and cities for guerilla training. Citizens are to stay out of the way as militiamen conduct urban house-to-house combat drills, and peasants should remain calm and try to stay out of their line of fire as they stealthily move through their wheat and cotton fields, popping up to take potshots at OPFOR training units. Some minor protest this has been reported but, frankly, Comrade Sundarayya believes the proletariat should be grateful for all the good the militias have done for them. We owe our socialist paradise to them, and we must make necessary accommodations for their continued success."

 india.4010.t:0 "The Revolutionary Guard"
 india.4010.desc:0 "While leaving the militia units as autonomous yet integrated units within the army has proven effective at creating dedicated, zealously loyal guerrilla forces, it's been a bit of a bureaucratic headache to deal with every militia unit as a separate administrative entity. Some simplification of the militia system was clearly necessary...\n\nToday Comrade Sundarayya, flanked by camo-fatigued militia bosses, gave a landmark speech inaugurating the new branch of the Indian Peoples military, the Revolutionary Guard. the Revolutionary Guard shall act as a loose amalgamation of autonomous militia units democratically deciding their structure and operations. They shall be responsible for procurement, recruitment, training, and operations, and the people of India shall be expected to assist them with their mission in any way feasible\n\nThe Revolutionary Guard militias have been crucial to our victory, and they are the vanguard who shall lead the way in the realization of our great socialist dream. Filled with zeal for Comrade Sundarayya and the Raoist doctrine, they shall guide the people towards the light of communism, surely the people will be grateful for their leadership and grant their requests. However strange or demanding the Revolutionary Guards might be towards the people, Comrade Sundarayya expects that they shall all trust in the torchbearers of the Revolution."

 india.4011.t:0 "Establishment of the Secret Division"
 india.4011.desc:0 "Officially, the events of today never happened.\n\nElite, clandestine training for a secret black ops unit was not completed today, for it had never begun. the best of the best of our fighting forces had not been recruited some time ago to serve in a nonexistent unit. If this unit existed, which it doesn't, it would not be used for deniable subversive revolutionary activities at home and abroad. It would definitely operate under full purview of the army command structure and our national laws and would not be personally answerable to Comrade Sundarayya himself. We are not using this unit, which, as a reminder, does not exist, to carry out intelligence operations or political assassinations. No secret and illegal revolutionary activities will be conducted by this unit, because this unit does not exist.\n\nYou did not receive this message, please destroy it immediately after you finish reading."

 faminerisk.1.desc:0 "You may not realize it, sitting in a well-catered government office all day and sleeping in a mansion all night, but most of the subcontinent suffers from chronic food insecurity.\n\nOur population is numerous, and poor, and India has known recurring famine for thousands of years. In the past, kings would often offer various famine-relief measures from reducing taxes, digging canals, promoting migration to even out the realm, or just throwing open the grain stores and kitchens and letting people eat their fill. Unfortunately, while the Indian population has only increased more and more rapidly over time, our agricultural and general economic development lags decades behind the industrialized West. Unless we take strong measures to secure ourselves against famines, death may soon sweep across our land and throw the entire country into a tumult."

 faminerisk.2.t:0 "The Indian Climate"
 faminerisk.2.desc:0 "India's climate is simultaneously one of the best and one of the worst in the world for agriculture. On the one hand, it is very warm and wet, lending itself very well to growing most crops. Everything from staple grains to nutritious vegetables and exotic fruits all thrive on the subcontinent. However, the climate is also very tempestuous, and while it gives it also has a tendency to take away. During the wet season, India is often battered by massive monsoons that can devastate communities and their farms. It is hard to predict these monsoons and even harder to properly prepare farms and poor communities for them. To make matters worse, they are not very consistent, and they can be much worse some years than others. This is a common theme with the climate, and so while India's boom years are magnificent, its low years are even harsher than in other areas. Drought especially can ruin a year and leave many to starve. For these reasons, India's climate is a serious factor to consider when discussing the risk of famine."

 faminerisk.3.desc:0 "While a fierce monsoon may cause flooding and landslides, the scorching heat of the hot seasons in India can turn lush grasslands into deserts within days. the loo winds of the Northern dry season can prove fatal, and insufficient monsoon rains can lead to famine-inducing droughts in the dry season. It is one of two deadly climatic threats which we must secure our subcontinent against.\n\nTo safeguard the subcontinent against the heat of the dry season, India will have to undertake extensive water infrastructure work. Irrigation systems will need to be constructed and linked to the farmlands. We will need to construct reservoirs using dams and advanced rainwater capture techniques to ensure we have a stable backup supply of drinking water, filtered through water treatment plants. To truly secure India, even more extreme measures may be needed; including implementing water rationing systems, and mandating flow restrictors on private faucets. It will be exorbitantly costly, but such is the price of preventing mass death."

 faminerisk.33.t:0 "Arid Infrastructure Complete"
 faminerisk.33.desc:0 "After much hard work, we have hardened India's agricultural infrastructure against the threat of the dry season. the most extensive and expensive aspect was the expansion of the irrigation network, which now covers countless farms across the nation. Dozens of canals and aqueducts now bring good water to nourish the crops of many farmers. Many are equipped with new waste filtration systems to ensure that industrial waste from the cities in the rivers does not make its way to the crops. Furthermore, they also bring drinking water, so that neither the humans nor their crops are ever thirsty. These are not all that were built, however; several new dams are now under construction. They will hold great reservoirs of water that will remain even when the dry season is upon us, and the dams themselves can be used for a multitude of purposes. Overall, we are now much more prepared for the dry season, and our farmers will not have to worry about whether or not they'll have water once the clouds drift away and the sun scorches the earth."

More urgently, the rains destroy any harvests still growing in the fields.\n\nThere are many easy ways to limit the effects of monsoons, but they're not free. A moderate investment will go a long way in containing the monsoons."

This is where disaster relief teams come in. These would consist of trained medical personnel, engineers, and soldiers who would travel across the nation to the most hard-hit areas. They would provide emergency food and supplies, repair damaged facilities necessary for survival, and provide much-needed medical attention. They would stay as long as they were needed and not a second more, as they will certainly be required in many places. They would even help fight disasters like fires caused by a potential dry season. They would be some of the best and bravest of India, and they would be necessary to provide proper aid to the most affected areas of the subcontinent if famine were to strike."

With such a huge pool of talent to draw from, each team was able to fill all its roles with competent people, and there was no shortage of medical personnel as was feared would happen. Each team has a proper hierarchy, a direct line of command to higher authorities, and the vehicles and resources needed to travel rapidly across the country and respond to emergencies. They have overall done excellently in training exercises and practices, and it they're ready to move out as soon as we need them.

 faminerisk.6.desc:0 "While many of the factors that could cause famine are largely out of any man's hands, there are a few key ones that are directly caused by humans. the most prominent of these is pollution. While industrialization has been considered by and large a good thing for India and truly most nations, what with it bringing countless jobs, modern technology, and mass-produced goods, it also has several downsides. Pollution has already begun to manifest itself in some of the nation's rivers, the industrial damage doing real damage to ecosystems, and more importantly to farms and fields. Furthermore, the waste can taint the soil for many decades, rendering it unusable for a very significant timeframe. Even normal human waste that all people create can make watersheds undrinkable to people if still usable for agriculture. For these reasons, India must take a serious look at the potential problems with pollution, and see if it's worth making some real reform to preserve the soil and water."

 faminerisk.7.t:0 "Famine Panic"
 faminerisk.7.desc:0 "After much deliberation over the potential threat of famine, the rumours have now made their way to the public who are reaching a true panic. Mistaking preparation for the worst as a certain prediction, newspapers are printing sensationalist headlines and demagogues are shouting imminent doom. People have even started to hoard food and water. People are expressing real concern over the risk of famine and starvation, and all are justifiably demanding the government to do something.\n\nThe government's primary response has been to open up a new wave of investment in agriculture. the state is providing funding for everything from major agricultural conglomerates to individual family farms in the countryside. These investments are often focused on preparing these farms for a potential famine, so they can continue to produce or at least survive if worst comes to worst. Hopefully these investments will soften the blow and bring more support to the government's efforts."
 faminerisk.7.a:0 "Support your local farmers!"
 
 faminerisk.8.t:0 "Failed Investments"
 faminerisk.8.desc:0 "Despite the government's best efforts, the investments in improving agriculture have turned out less than spectacular. While the funding was intended to be used to better prepare farms for a potential famine, it eventually became clear that that was not going to work all that well. the climate of India is simply too tempestuous and the crops too fragile. Any preparations that could be made would be minor at best and would do the same amount of work as a rain trap against a tsunami. What's even worse is that the government still sunk a good chunk of funding into these efforts that can not be recovered.\n\nThe only remaining option is to hope for the best. Famine is still not certain to happen, and these are only preparatory measures for if one happens and not a response to one certainly happening. With some luck, India could still have a good year and the people will be fed. If not, however, we can only pray that the current agricultural methods will be enough to stockpile and get the people through until the end."
 faminerisk.8.a:0 "So much money, wasted..."
 
 faminerisk.9.t:0 "International Sources"
 faminerisk.9.desc:0 "With famine seeming to loom ever closer, India is now forced to look elsewhere for help. the fact is that India will simply not be able to produce enough food to feed its own people. That doesn't mean, however, that we won't be able to find other sources. It'll just be a good bit more expensive. There are plenty of big nations with surplus food to sell, and they'll be happy to give it to us as long as we bring our checkbooks. Our neighbors, others in the Indian Ocean, and even powers far abroad are all potentially viable sources of food for India. While the cost will end up being higher than we like, we may simply not have a choice if the famine gets bad. Our people need to be fed, and there's no time to squabble over where the food comes from when people are starving."
 faminerisk.9.a:0 "Let's see who's willing to sell."
 
 faminerisk.10.t:0 "Importing Food"
 faminerisk.10.desc:0 "After much consideration and deliberation, we've decided that there are three major options when it comes to importing food to stave off famine. They are as follows: set up deals with our neighbors, look out across the Indian Ocean, or cast the widest net and enter the international market. Each has its pros and cons, and none of them will be particularly cheap, but we have to make a decision in order to keep the people fed.\n\nSticking with our neighbors is the cheapest option, as the transport costs will be much less. However, it's easier said than done. Relations with many of our neighbors are chilly at best, and while nobody will say no to making a few rupees it'll be difficult negotiating deals that are in our favor. Furthermore, our neighbors may simply not have the capacity to feed the titanic population of India.\n\nThe Indian Ocean is vast and holds much potential for trade. We'd certainly have a wide choice of partners, but the costs would also go up. We would also likely have to buy from Japan and its puppets, which would be a headache to say the least. There are also ethical concerns, as buying from tyrannical colonialist powers like Japan, Italy, and Germany and using the fruits of imperialism would be both hypocritical and immoral.\n\nWe could just buy from across the world. While this offers both the greatest amount of product and the widest variety of choice, it is also the most expensive by far. Shipping food from Brazil, America, and Europe would be extremely costly, and it might not be worth it. We'd also have to work around many different nations' trade laws, further complicating the process. Still, this option is very tempting."
 faminerisk.10.a:0 "Set up trade deals with our neighbours. §R(10 million dollars)§!."

 faminerisk.11.t:0 "Foreign Aid"
 faminerisk.11.desc:0 "As hard as it is to admit, it has to be said that the prospect of famine is now approaching the level of a crisis. Fortunately for the people of India, other nations around the world do like to make at least a token effort to show that they care about the poor and hungry of other nations. Many countries provide aid to nations with a poorer populace so that those people can live and eat in safety without fearing starvation. There are also privately run charities that do their best to aid those in need, using money donated by citizens to do good. the famine is just the kind of thing that we could get that kind of assistance for.\n\nWhile the nation that first comes to mind when searching for this sort of aid is America, it is certainly not the only one that provides international aid. Italy and even Japan have programs for assisting the sick and hungry of other nations, as well as Iberia. Still, America and its allies in the OFN are the most likely candidates when it comes to searching for international aid. We shall just have to see who's willing to help us."

 faminerisk.12.t:0 "New Study Causes Worry"
 faminerisk.12.desc:0 "With famine looming ever closer, the academics of India were very interested when a new international study was released covering the cost of living in the subcontinent. While there was hope that it would show that things weren't quite as bad as they seemed, it instead only brought spirits lower, as it did not contain good news. Instead, the study concluded that when considering factors like purchasing power, standard of living, and average income, India is actually fairly expensive for the average person, and that cost is greatest when it comes to buying food. Not only did they throw away hopes that the famine might not raise food prices too much, they actually concluded that Indians can barely afford food costs as it is, and even a minor rise in those costs would lead to mass hunger and average Indians being unable to afford food. This is grim news indeed."

Advances in technology have already boosted food output exponentially over the past century and a half. Perhaps new technological advances could be used to counter the famine! All sorts of technologies could help: fertilizers, farming vehicles, anti-pollution tech, and more could all reduce the impact of the famine on India. Because of this, it has been decided that the government will set up research grants for foreign researchers in the hopes that they will develop something that can help keep the common people from starving. India has the money, now it just needs people to take it. the risk is so severe that the government is basically willing to write a blank check for anyone with a somewhat decent scientific proposal to help counter the famine. We can only hope that money is used for what it's intended and not more questionable purposes."

Though not the most popular course of action, economists around the country have stated that we can recover the lost expenses if we raise taxes, but that is deeply unpopular amongst the poor and the socialists of this nation who want a good portion of the income from the tax hike to be spent on welfare programs. It is safe to say that the Azad Hind has successfully managed to weaken this nation once again."

He requests an unusual trade offer: Significant tons of food supplied to India overland as a safeguard against famine, and in return India would make potentially millions of laborers available to us at exclusive, remarkably low wages.\n\nThe deal comes with various advantages for us. India's tremendous population could see to it that we can cheaply employ more workers for our industrial projects than we have citizens! This labour would be almost entirely unskilled, but by outsourcing jobs to Indian factories we could produce consumer goods that sell at an incredible profit. Indian laborers could also be shipped here to work directly on our construction projects, though the logistics of this may be difficult to arrange.\n\nThe biggest downside to the proposal is what they request in return. Put simply, Iran is no agricultural giant. Only 12% of our land is under cultivation, and we're one of the world's largest wheat importers despite also being a significant producer. While we have a near monopoly on the saffron market, it's scarcely a nutritious and widely available crop. the best we have to offer the Indians nutritionally is pistachios, of which we are the world's largest producer.

As a result, the Italian agricultural economy is still largely sustained by colonial imports, with limited measures currently underway to boost non-colonial imports.

Furthermore, the once-great empire of Iran also collapsed into outright civil war with multiple sides having backing from Japan, Germany, and the United States, driving oil prices up even higher and creating a potentially threatening nation right on our doorstep. To make things even worse, Muslims in our country are not happy and just outside of our borders are not happy, with attacks by [PAK.GetNameDEF] becoming even more frequent and Islamist terrorist groups gaining strength in Afghanistan.

 RAJ_Start_Wildcard:0 "Asia's Last Democracy"
 RAJ_Start_Wildcard_desc:0 "At one time, there were many democracies in Asia. Free, thriving, and made of their own people and their will. But this was intolerable for fascism. Germany and Japan marched upon Russia and China. There are still many nations in Asia, but there is a difference; no longer are they free. No longer do they listen to the people. Now, to be a nation in Asia is to be a nation of secret police, military jackboots, and oppression of your own people. Now, there is only one democracy in Asia. And it is us."
 RAJ_Start_Oppressed:0 "Our Oppressed"
 RAJ_Start_Oppressed_desc:0 "The legacy of British tyranny still casts a cold shadow over India. Those who would cooperate with our oppressors gained positions of power and exploited their own brethren for profit and personal gain. With the British chains thrown into the sea the enduring consequences of this black system still haunt the subcontinent, and until we help those who suffered under foreign reign the scars over our nation will never truly heal."
 RAJ_Start_Rejected:0 "Our Rejected"
 RAJ_Start_Rejected_desc:0 "Far too many innocent men and women are shunned in our society. the Dalit work harder than any other, but are viewed as the lowest as the low. Muslims, Jains, Sikhs, and more are viewed as outsiders to be distrusted, even though they have all been an integral part of India for centuries. We are the government of all, not the government of the majority, and as the government for all it is our duty to ensure that the tribalism and distrust of decades past is ended, once and for all."
 RAJ_Start_Poor:0 "Our Poor"
 RAJ_Start_Poor_desc:0 "Decades of exploitation and foreign rule have left many Indians cold and hungry every night. So many are forced to live in crumbling buildings, shanties, and even in the streets. Too great a number want for food, desperately rationing what they have among themselves and their families just to get by. These men and women are just as Indian as any other, and not one should ever have to worry about whether they will have shelter over their heads or if they will have enough food to last until the next week."
 RAJ_Start_Minorities:0 "The Minorities of India"
 RAJ_Start_Minorities_desc:0 "India is truly unlike any other nation in the world. Countless ethnic groups make up our populace and our linguistic variety is that of an entire continent. No other nation could so capably hold together such a diverse population, but we will show the world that India is one nation, united in spirit."
 RAJ_Start_Untouchable:0 "The Dalit"
 RAJ_Start_Untouchable_desc:0 "The caste system has brought suffering for millenia, but none have suffered more than the Dalit. the lowest of the low in society, these are the people who have toiled in the harshest conditions for no reason other than their birth, the humble laborers hated by those they serve. If we are to be a nation of the people, we cannot leave them behind."
 RAJ_Start_Keep_Fighting_Castes:0 "Keep Fighting the Castes"
 RAJ_Start_Keep_Fighting_Castes_desc:0 "The caste system has only served to divide our people as long as it has existed. It is unfair, cruel, and most importantly it makes us weaker. It prevents many from serving the nation where they are most fit because society demands they serve where their ancestors did. We must increase our efforts to abolish this archaic and inefficient system so that all Indians can have equality of opportunity."
 RAJ_Start_Continue_Welfare:0 "Continue Our Welfare Policies"
 RAJ_Start_Continue_Welfare_desc:0 "Our welfare programs have proven to be quite the success. We have lifted millions from the depths of poverty into positions where they can feed themselves and their families, and in turn they are able to become more productive members of our great nation. We must continue on this path so every Indian can safely have clothes on their backs and food in their bellies."
 RAJ_Start_AIML:0 "Talks with the AIML"
 RAJ_Start_AIML_desc:0 "If our nation is to hold together, we must be accepting of all the faiths of India. Tensions between Muslims and other Indians have been high for a long time, but we must never forget that they are Indians too and deserve just as much of a voice as any other. the AIML is perhaps the largest single group representing Indian Muslims, and so we should open a dialogue with them to better work with the Islamic community of our nation."
 RAJ_Start_Guru:0 "Meet Guruji"
 RAJ_Start_Guru_desc:0 "Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar may not hold the highest opinion of us, but his ideas and rhetoric have brought many citizens to his side. If so many Indians believe in the ideas of the so-called "Guruji" then we owe it to them to open up a dialogue and hear him out. Perhaps, if we're lucky, we can find some common ground and work together for the sake of unity."
 RAJ_Start_Communists:0 "Communist Dialogue"
 RAJ_Start_Communists_desc:0 "The communists have an open disdain for our government, but we aren't entirely opposed. Though they say they don't go far enough, the left has generally approved of our welfare programs, and in the end we all want what's best for India. Perhaps real meetings and some compromises might be just enough to satisfy the communists, at least for now?"
 RAJ_Start_Security_Indus:0 "Security on the Indus"
 RAJ_Start_Security_Indus_desc:0 "India itself is named for the Indus River, but in modern times this ancient birthplace of civilization is one of the most turbulent areas of our nation. There have been countless protests and riots, and many in the area are calling for a seperate state for Indian Muslims. This is completely ridiculous, and we must ensure that the law-abiding citizens of the area are not harmed by this unrest. We must bring security to the river, and ensure that India will remain a single nation, diverse in thought but united in purpose."
 RAJ_Start_Religious_Act:0 "The Religious Freedom Act"
 RAJ_Start_Religious_Act_desc:0 "Our nation has always been, at its heart, the home of many religions. From the Jains, to the Hindus, to the Buddhists, to the Muslims, and to everyone outside and in-between, we must ensure and enshrine their rights to practice their religion free of persecution. To this end we propose the Religious Freedom Act which will place restrictions on prejudiced actions against an individual for any religious beliefs they may hold because above all else, we're all human."
 RAJ_Start_Welfare_Act:0 "The Hindu Welfare Act"
 RAJ_Start_Welfare_Act_desc:0 "Our government's policies are good not because they blindly follow the example of the rest of the world, but rather because they are made to be uniquely Indian, incorporating our values and ideas to best serve the hardworking and diverse peoples of the subcontinent. One of the deepest-held values of our people is faith, and so we should incorporate this too into our government's efforts. the Hindu Welfare Act will combine many of the values of our largest religion with our successful welfare programs, making them uniquely suited to help the people of India."
 RAJ_Start_Rural_Act:0 "The Rural Aid Act"
 RAJ_Start_Rural_Act_desc:0 "Many of our programs so far have been aimed at huge, crowded cities like Bombay and Delhi. However, a great portion of Indians, and therefore a great amount of poverty, still reside in the rural regions of our nation. This is the true blood of our nation: the farmers, the herders, and the laborers who carry on the traditions of our country. By giving them the same support we have been giving elsewhere, we ensure our heart is strong so it can continue to pump prosperity through our veins. the Rural Aid Act will focus more on bringing our policies to these sparsely-populated areas so this can be achieved."
 RAJ_Start_End:0 "Three Hurrahs for Democratic Socialism!"
 RAJ_Start_End_desc:0 "Through much effort, compromise, and the Indian spirit, we have instituted some of the most sweeping and successful social programs in the world. Dalit now open their first small businesses and mingle with other castes. People who starved on the streets now do honest labor and bring home money for their families. Children who would have had no future because of their heritage now attend public schools and become educated so that they too can work hard and succeed. Welfare is not just charity, it is an investment in hard work and the Indian people, so that they can live good lives and contribute to their families, their communities, and their nation. Future generations will thank us for all that we have done to build a brighter tomorrow for India."

 RAJ_Explosion_A_Beautiful_New_Roof_desc:0 "The first thing that must be planned is a proper roof, of course. However, it is not so simple as going with whatever the architects pick, for they have given us two choices to pick from: the old roof, or a completely new roof of different design. The old is more cost-effective, but the new is (subjectively) more aesthetically pleasing. What will it be?"

As before, the architects have given us two choices: the old walls, just as we remember, and new ones, completely from the ground up. The old walls are more familiar (not to mention cheaper), while the new ones are safer for the people - at our expense. So, what shall we pick out for the most important part of the station?"

 RAJ_Explosion_With_Love_Government:0 "From the Government With Love"
 RAJ_Explosion_With_Love_Government_desc:0 "With all our speaking on how we would right the wrongs committed by the terrorist behind this bombing, we have conveniently avoided doing exactly that. However, this charade cannot be kept up forever - in fact, people have already started to notice, and the families of those who were not fortunate enough to survive the bombing have begun to demand compensation. It's bad to refuse it outright, and trying to sidestep even more will just make things worse, so we should just give it to them, already.\n\nWe have talked the talk, but now it is time for us to walk the walk."

 RAJ_Explosion_Talk_With_Survivors_desc:0 "We've been busy over the past few days. Trying to fix up the station, looking for the killer, identifying the dead, and so on and so forth. However, there remains one group that we have forgotten about - the survivors. Those who possessed the grit to live through the bomb blast. Yet, we have neglected to even check up on them. So, what's the harm in sending a representative to do that, and increase our popularity, while he's at it?\n\nWe have walked the walk, but now it is time for us to talk the talk."

It's quite simple, concise, and to the point - and used for political or historical statements far more than paintings nowadays. So, we'll find a decent artist, and hire them to make a mural for us, showing to all those who pass through the new station the sacrifices that were made on that fateful day by the people of India."

 RAJ_Explosion_Dedicate_a_Song_desc:0 "While there are simpler ways to show one's gratitude, such as a mural or even mere handouts, this was not a simple tragedy. The victims of one of the worst terrorist attacks in India's history must be honored in the most grandiose of ways - including a song, of course! The concept's quite simple, perhaps even more than a mural or a novel. Just a sad song in memory of the victims of the bombing. The only problem is that we need to find someone to sing it..."

 RAJ_Explosion_Dedicate_a_Novel_Bypass_tt:0 "§RWe have elected to not write a novel, after many severe objections to the very idea.§!"
 RAJ_Explosion_Dedicate_a_Novel_desc:0 "Things like a mural and a song are simple, of course, and it's good that they're in the plans, as well, but we must have the cherry on top; a full-length novel based on and dedicated to the experiences of the victims of the bombing! Some might say it's in poor taste, but it's certainly a great idea - when some would-be murderer knows the true experiences of the people they're going after, they'll think twice, not to mention the emotional value it'll have to normal people, as well."

We've saved our own hides, and not only helped the victims and their families, but played a part in rebuilding the economy of our largest city after such a vile act of terrorism.

With the Indian National Congress in their control a new era of responsible government is just around the corner. India has been spurned by the left policies of the Nehru government, and the time has come for spending to be cut and the welfare state relaxed, all in the name of our future prosperity. Sure, some might become upset as their safety net withers, but it's for their own good. Oh, and yes, the Social Liberals have estranged members of all parties and still have to navigate the religious conflicts, communist agitators, and their roadmap for caste reform seems like a bumpy ride, and sure, the All India Muslim League will be constantly breathing down their necks now that the strongest leader the INC will ever have is dead, and they ultimately will be living in his shadow for decades to come, but the social liberals definitely know what they're doing.

This is the kind of radical change that economists will study for years to come. Let us hope they only have good things to say."
 RAJ_move_towards_ISI_economy:0 "Move Towards an ISI Economy"
 RAJ_move_towards_ISI_economy_desc:0 "In such a turbulent and dangerous world, it is best that we support ourselves rather than rely on imports from potentially unstable and risky sellers. We must work harder to make sure that we depend on Indian industry, Indian business, and Indian products. Not only will this insure us against changes abroad, it will be much better for the people of India. This economic plan will create more work for our citizens and bring us closer to self-sustaining prosperity for years to come."
 RAJ_finish_economy_reforms:0 "Finish Economy Reforms"
 RAJ_finish_economy_reforms_desc:0 "Our plans are drawn up, our budgets are finalized, our policies are passed. We are finally actually putting our reforms into action. Through many tireless days of hard work by our lawmakers, we have put together a series of reforms that will not only revitalize our economy but also bring prosperity to both individual Indians and to our nation as a whole. We just have to dot some i's and cross some t's, and then all that we'll have to do is wait and see how well our new policies perform."

 RAJ_second_reforms:0 "Further Reforms"
 RAJ_second_reforms_desc:0 "Our victories in the election has entrenched us as the dominant power in Indian parliamentary politics, but the real work lies ahead. While we hold the mandate, we should push through some basic, generally agreeable reforms through the Lok Sabha.\n\nWe will need to consider our options moving forward, however. We aren't the only party in Parliament, and to advance our cause, we should at least consider forming some sort of a coalition."
 RAJ_soc_lib_socdem_coalition_2:0 "Further Cooperation with the INC"
 RAJ_soc_lib_socdem_coalition_2_desc:0 "The Indian National Congress is the oldest and most singularly established party in modern Indian politics, as they were among the first to push for Indian independence from the old empire.\n\nWhile they aren't quite as dedicated to the ideals of personal property and personal liberty as we are, Congress has their hearts in the right place, and if we are willing to compromise a little and work with them, we can make life better for many in India."
 RAJ_Soclib_soclib_socdem_military:0 "Adjust the Military Budget"
 RAJ_Soclib_soclib_socdem_military_desc:0 "The Indian National Congress has recently stood opposed to the amount of our annual budget that gets eaten up by the Republic's military branches, and it is an area we're willing to work with them on. A truly free nation doesn't need to keep a large, expensive military on hand all the time, after all.\n\nIf we lower the budget a bit, it'll free up funds for social programs that the Congress likes so much, and it'll help reinforce that the Republic of India is not a state of warmongers."
 RAJ_decrease_tarrifs:0 "Decrease Tarrifs"
 RAJ_decrease_tarrifs_desc:0 "Free trade is an ideal to which we strive. If we lower our tariffs on foreign imports as a whole, companies and other countries will flock to India to do business, and the country will flourish.\n\nWe won't directly benefit from it, but soon Indian supermarkets will be stocked with goods and products from all over the world, and our people won't be wanting for anything."
 RAJ_invite_foreign_buissness:0 "Invite Foreign Business"
 RAJ_invite_foreign_buissness_desc:0 "India has a respectable local industry, it's true. But we're still considerably behind the developed world in that field. Building up our own industry will take time, but every moment is precious, so we should look at short term options in the meantime.\n\nWe can invite foreign businesses to India, offer them lower tax rates in exchange for them building their factories and building up their businesses on the subcontinent. The influx of new jobs should give the economy a nice boost."
 RAJ_decrease_spending_further:0 "Cut the Military Drain Further"
 RAJ_decrease_spending_further_desc:0 "Even with recent budget cuts, the Indian Military could still stand to have some of the fat trimmed from it, for lack of a better term. Rather than directly striking at the budget this time, we'll be going after some of the less obvious expenses.\n\nThis program will mainly attack various inefficiencies and deficiencies within the command structure, training methods, research programs, and day-to-day maintenance of the military. Which means more money going to improving the nation, even the military!"
 RAJ_Border_forts:0 "Fortifications on the Western Border"
 RAJ_Border_forts_desc:0 "While we're in accord on the state of the military, neither we nor the National Congress are stupid. Our western frontier near the Indus is bound to be a hotspot for Islamic nationalist agitation.\n\nSo while the budget for the military will be significantly reduced, we need to accommodate for this lack of outright strength by beefing up our western border, in case open fighting breaks out."
 RAJ_Soclib_lower_reservists:0 "Less Quantity"
 RAJ_Soclib_lower_reservists_desc:0 "It used to be once that great powers could wage war by simply handing a large cross-section of peasantry with simple weapons and pointing them at the enemy. This mentality has unfortunately carried in its own understated way to the modern day. India has a large population, yes, but we do not need so many bodies in the military itself.\n\nThe overcrowding of the military only serves to make us less efficient, and create weaknesses in our operations that an enemy can exploit. We need to tighten the slack."
 RAJ_Increase_training:0 "More Quality"
 RAJ_Increase_training_desc:0 "With the number of bodies required to staff the military reduced, we can now spend additional resources- resources that would have normally be used on large recruitment campaigns and equipping entirely too many soldiers - on training the soldiers we did keep. From the officers to the grunts, we need to improve our training methods.\n\nA chain is only as strong as its weakest link, after all, and with the fate of the Republic on the line, we could use one strong "chain" if you would."
 RAJ_Increase_training_tt:0 "We cannot have our soldiers using old, rusting weapons!"
 RAJ_Soclib_surgical_force:0 "India's Finest"
 RAJ_Soclib_surgical_force_desc:0 "With the military downsized, reformed, and strengthened through improved officer and enlisted training, it's fair to say that the resulting Indian Military is one of the greatest in the world.\n\nNot as large as our population might be able to boast, but they don't waste money, they don't waste time, and they won't waste away. Truly, these are India's Finest, and they are the defenders of liberty and truth. Vande Mataram!"
 RAJ_Progressing_further:0 "India Greater a Bit More"
 RAJ_Progressing_further_desc:0 "Our partnership with the National Congress has reaped great rewards. India now has a stronger, more effective military than it has ever boasted. Its people are freer, and the caste system has never been less relevant to the common Indian than it is now.\n\nOur efforts have paid off, and India is cementing herself as a cornerstone of not just Asia, but a pillar on the global stage as well."
 RAJ_Progressing_further_tt:0 "Leftism has saved India!"
 RAJ_Soclib_pure_2:0 "True to Liberal Ideas"
 RAJ_Soclib_pure_2_desc:0 "Our position in the Lok Sabha is one such that we don't need to align ourselves with the center-left, nor the moderate-right. We can stand on our own, and push through our own reforms as we see fit.\n\nIt won't be as comfortable a majority as we might like, but it will do for our purposes, and it will ensure that our message of liberty and security don't end up tainted by either the left or the right. We hold the popular mandate!"
 RAJ_Soclib_uniting_the_nation:0 "Uniting the Nation"
 RAJ_Soclib_uniting_the_nation_desc:0 "India will be impossible to govern until we bring its people together. We must be united regardless of creed, race, gender and political allegiance; we are all citizens of the republic, and in this time of crisis, we shall not budge an inch to the traitors and vagabonds who wish to destroy us. India shall survive this and emerge a modern nation, and a force to be reckoned with at that!"
 RAJ_Increase_caste_qutoas:0 "Increase Caste Quotas"
 RAJ_Increase_caste_qutoas_desc:0 "So far, the government has made steps towards ensuring that members of lower castes get representation in education, government jobs, even parliament seats. It is technically the farthest reaching example of affirmative action - and it isn't enough. Lower caste members still face discrimination, violence and punishment for speaking out. We must ensure that all of India's citizens are happy in their lives and don't fear any sort of oppression from an outside force."
 RAJ_anti_corruption_mesuares:0 "Anti-Corruption Measures"
 RAJ_anti_corruption_mesuares_desc:0 "Our nation suffers from a dangerous amount of corruption. Everyone from low-level bureaucrats to the highest offices in the nation have some kind of scandal that needs to be unearthed. We must do whatever we can to rid ourselves of selfish, unpatriotic forces which plan on drowning our republic in dirty money and unforgivable crimes against the people."
 RAJ_Community_policing:0 "The Goverment's Hand With a Human Face"
 RAJ_Community_policing_desc:0 "The people have no need to fear us. By showing our policies in painstaking and efficient detail, we can show them that we are fighting for them, and not anyone else. the reminder than in our republic, the people are sovereign, is a strong one, and will not be forgotten by friend or foe."
 RAJ_Soclib_build_bridges:0 "Bridge Building"
 RAJ_Soclib_build_bridges_desc:0 "Continued effort needs to be made into ensuring that our people stay united in these violent and dangerous times. Public meetings with locals, talks with important representatives of each caste, anti-radical propaganda - whatever can be done, should be done. the republic can only survive if we stay together, or else we shall face a crisis far worse than ever before seen."
 RAJ_Continue_releiving_tensions:0 "Further Easing the Tensions"
 RAJ_Continue_releiving_tensions_desc:0 "Our work is beginning to see its rewards. People are beginning to come to their senses, and we are getting closer every day to a calm, collected public. We just need some final pushes for unity; propaganda, meeting with local leaders, speeches; whatever can be done, must be done. the people united will never be defeated."
 RAJ_soc_lib_soccon_coalition_2:0 "A Friend in Desai"
 RAJ_soc_lib_soccon_coalition_2_desc:0 "The Janata Party is a split group from the Indian National Congress. The Party is rather ideologically opposed to their former parent party, mostly aligned for the sake of Indian independence's sake rather than for any ideological similarities. They represent the largest bloc of conservatives in the Lok Sabha.\n\nWe can secure our position if we're willing to compromise a little and work with the Party to form a coalition. They aren't as dedicated to the cause of personal liberties, but an emphasis on tradition and maintaining a strong India may make up for that."
 RAJ_Increase_economic_liberty:0 "Increase Economic Liberty"
 RAJ_Increase_economic_liberty_desc:0 "Liberty is meaningless if it does not apply to all spheres of life. By enhancing the power of property and purchasing power, our economy will do better and our people will enjoy the fruits of freedom more. Loads of money and more liberty; that's the Indian way."
 RAJ_decrease_corp_tax:0 "Decrease Corporate Tax"
 RAJ_decrease_corp_tax_desc:0 "As of now, thanks to Congress, large businesses pay far too much for their labour. This disincentivizes foreign companies from bringing their jobs and money here, and it makes our own corporations turn to dodging the taxes in illegal and legal ways. We still need money for government services, but as of right now, we need to ensure that our allies in the West don't feel threatened when they try to build up our industry."
 RAJ_Increase_subsidies:0 "Increase Subsidies"
 RAJ_Increase_subsidies_desc:0 "The direct intervention of the social democrats are too blunt for an economy like our own. Instead, we can create incentives for people to buy what we want. By giving Indian companies money, we can keep the prices of those goods low, so that people can afford to buy it. This allows for more money to flow through the economy, and ensures that the companies we support can get the items they're selling off the shelves."
 RAJ_Invest_air_india:0 "Invest in Indian Airlines"
 RAJ_Invest_air_india_desc:0 "Our nation must become more modern in order to survive the onslaught of fascist, revanchist and despotic powers at our doors. By ensuring that our people can travel anywhere in the world, at anytime, we can begin to show Western companies that we are a worthy investment. Our future lay in the skies - let us chase after it until our dream is completed!"
 RAJ_Soclib_trade_commission:0 "Trade Commisions"
 RAJ_Soclib_trade_commission_desc:0 "One of the more harmful results of promoting businesses is the creation of monopolies. By completely squeezing out the opposition, large companies can stop all competition in a market and control the product in its entirety. We must ensure that smaller businesses and those who wish to climb the corporate ladder are protected, by enacting anti-monopoly legislation, to ensure that coercion plays no role in the marketplace."
 RAJ_Soclib_economy_grows:0 "The Economy Grows"
 RAJ_Soclib_economy_grows_desc:0 "The triumph of progress is beginning to show in our republic. More businesses are beginning to spring up than ever before, and the flow of money in our economy is showing some serious results. While our work is far from done, pat yourself on the back; we are winning. Against all the forces that worked to bring us down, we are coming out on top, and no one can say otherwise."
 RAJ_Soclib_economy_grows_tt:0 "India will be better than ever before!"
 RAJ_best_both_worlds:0 "Best of Both Worlds"
 RAJ_best_both_worlds_desc:0 "We are combining the merits of both the conservative and social democratic approach. Our social attitude has made us friends amongst the left, while our economic policies has made the right consider us temporary allies. We are not only enacting sane policy, but we are also making smart political plays. Our government is smart and moral; we do not have to choose between one or the other."
 RAJ_best_both_worlds_tt:0 "Centre is best."
 RAJ_economic_social_policy:0 "Economic Social Policy"
 RAJ_economic_social_policy_desc:0 "Our policies of economic and political freedom are not disjointed causes, but one and the same. Without freedom from discrimination, the people cannot flourish in the market. Without the freedom to buy and spend, once again, the people cannot flourish in society. We must remind all that India is a progressive and free nation, and shall not discriminate on issues of race or price."
 RAJ_economic_social_policy_tt:0 "Free market and free people are interconnected."
 RAJ_redistribute_regional_spending:0 "Redistribute Regional Spending"
 RAJ_redistribute_regional_spending_desc:0 "The usage of money right now is completely unbalanced and not helpful for our government. Local governments are inclined to spend based on caste or political interests, which directly worsens the conditions of the other people in the region. We must ensure that regional spending is used to the benefit of all, and if that requires our direct intervention, then so be it."
 RAJ_redistribute_regional_spending_tt:0 "We shall redistribute spending for our regions into general government spending. §RSome regions may not like this!§!"
 RAJ_enforce_EoO_laws:0 "Enforce Equality of Employment Laws"
 RAJ_enforce_EoO_laws_desc:0 "No one should be denied employment because of who they are. Matters of caste, political beliefs, religious creed, race, gender and class are unimportant to determining the worth of a worker. the ability to work efficiently and obediently is the most important traits of an employee, and we must remind the businesses of our nation that. If they don't care, so what? They don't make the rules."
 RAJ_enforce_EoO_laws_tt:0 "Woman and man, equal."
# RAJ_decrease_tarrifs_desc:0 "Tariffs imposed by the previous government are not helping a bit. Foreign companies that are willing to build our nation are being punished for their charity. We should act immediately, and ensure that any company that wishes to work towards bettering our country are allowed to, and are not prohibited by archaic laws. Let us tell the world: your business is our business." #duplicate loc key
 RAJ_decrease_tarrifs_tt:0 "Taxes are bad, in all ways."
# RAJ_invite_foreign_buissness_desc:0 "We've talked a lot about getting foreign businesses to come and help build up our industry. Now, we should actually start doing that now that everyone who could stop it is out of the way. This will not only benefit our economy, but it will also but us on good terms with the OFN and ensure that they see us as allies and not enemies." #duplicate loc key
 RAJ_invite_foreign_buissness_tt:0 "India's rich! Invest in India!"
 RAJ_freer_the_market:0 "Freer the Market..."
 RAJ_freer_the_market_desc:0 "The less restrictions on the market, the better. the ability to develop freely and without restraint is a good principle for normal people, and it's even better for the owners of resources, industry and capital. We need to keep rolling back tariffs and taxes to ensure that India is business friendly."
 RAJ_freer_the_market_tt:0 "Economic liberalism, for the people!"
 RAJ_freer_the_people:0 "...Freer the People"
 RAJ_freer_the_people_desc:0 "The ultimate principle of liberalism is liberty. Without it, societies become oppressive, weak and contrary to nature. We understand this better than any other party in India, and we have no reason to abandon this principle. Our liberation of the market shall ensure that the people may buy and spend whatever they please, without restraint. This is freedom, take it or leave it."
 RAJ_freer_the_people_tt:0 "And personal freedom, for India!"

 RAJ_Pakistan_issue:0 "The Muslim Issue"
 RAJ_Pakistan_issue_desc:0 "Islam in India is at a crossroads. the All-India Muslim League is demanding the immediate independence of their people, while the RSS harasses non-Hindus and demands the stripping of their autonomy. We must make a decision about this issue, that will effect Indian politics forever."
 RAJ_Pakistan_independence:0 "Muslim Independence"
 RAJ_Pakistan_independence_desc:0 "It has become clear that unity between Muslims and Hindus was not meant to be, despite the hopes of many. We will be granting the All-India Muslim League control of Muslim-majority areas near the Afghan border. However, it is not as simple as a granting of independence and then leaving the newborn country for dead - we must figure out how to best organise this."
 RAJ_Prep_for_independence:0 "Start Preparations"
 RAJ_Prep_for_independence_desc:0 "We can't just leave the Muslim nation for dead, as the British did to us those decades ago. Instead, we must begin preparations alongside the Muslim League for this new nation - its government, its structure, its borders, its name, and so on and so forth.

 RAJ_Prep_the_trains:0 "Prepare the Trains"
 RAJ_Prep_the_trains_desc:0 "Muslim independence will not be clean. We have learned from the War of Independence that a line in the sand will result in a messy, violent exchange of our people, with Muslims crossing westwards and Hindus eastwards.

We can find a better solution, and that is the road we shall travel; we shall bring forth a nation within a nation, and give the Muslims an Autonomous District Council under the central government."

 ##Caste Crisis Tree##
 #####################
 RAJ_Caste_Denial:0 "Denial"
 RAJ_Caste_Denial_desc:0 "India is unequal, and the caste system makes it that way. But the people of India are naturally lovers of freedom and have the interests of all Indians in their hearts. We can show them that the way to a truly free and just India is through subverting the caste system and bringing true equality."
 RAJ_Caste_Denial_Rich:0 "The Rich Help Others"
 RAJ_Caste_Denial_Rich_desc:0 "India has a large and productive upper class that can be called upon to help us help India! So far they haven't been receptive to our calls to action, very few of them are making any serious donations to charities to help bring equality to India, and advocacy is rare.\n\nSurely they just need a bit of a push, get a little pressure on them and they'll get with the program!"
 RAJ_Caste_Denial_Agri:0 "Agricultural Aid"
 RAJ_Caste_Denial_Agri_desc:0 "Dalit farmers are amongst the most vulnerable in India, especially new ones trying to take advantage of equality laws to begin their enterprises. If they're to remain competitive- or even just able to keep up with established farms owned by people of other castes - they're going to need some level of support from the state.\n\nAgricultural subsidies to Dalit farmers should do the trick."
 RAJ_Caste_Denial_Religion:0 "Religious Peace"
 RAJ_Caste_Denial_Religion_desc:0 "The caste system is, at least in theory, tied to the Hindu religion. While radically twisted and perverted by the British, that doesn't stop prominent pundits from supporting the system with a religious justification.\n\nWe'll need to deal with the pundits somehow and gain their support- or at least their acquiescence- if we're going to move forward. The path to equality will be rocky enough as it stands."
 RAJ_Caste_Anger:0 "Anger"
 RAJ_Caste_Anger_desc:0 "It's not fair! Neither the system is, nor the reactions to our attempts to change it! We have nothing but the best of intentions, but even nudging India towards greater equality with a light hand and soft touch has sparked ire and resistance in the established castes..."
 RAJ_Caste_Anger_Higher:0 "Curb Higher Castes"
 RAJ_Caste_Anger_Higher_desc:0 "The Brahmins and Khastriyas have not just been unsupportive, they've been actively obstructive in our efforts to bring equality to India! We had hoped their Indian spirit would overcome their selfishness and greed, but hoping evidently is not enough.\n\nLet's look at our options for maybe making them finally look past their own pigheaded, corrupted self-interest..."
 RAJ_Caste_Anger_Farmer:0 "Farmers, Rise"
 RAJ_Caste_Anger_Farmer_desc:0 "It isn't just about the Untouchables. The labor caste, the Shudras, are weighed down by expectations and tradition as well. We need to mobilize them as well, the farmers especially! If they join in the fight, we can't possibly fail!\n\nThe time to rise up is now! Strike while the iron's hot!"
 RAJ_Caste_Anger_System:0 "Fight the System"
 RAJ_Caste_Anger_System_desc:0 "This isn't going to be some bureaucratic process that gently turns India into a truly free and equal state. Rather, it's going to be a fight against an entrenched and inbred system. But that's fine, nothing worth having is free after all, and a better India is certainly worth having.\n\nIt's not just a fight, but it's one we have to win, and one that we will, so as long as everyone's willing to join in the battle!"
 RAJ_Caste_Bargain:0 "Bargaining"
 BEN_Caste_Bargain_desc:0 "Maybe we could compromise a little? Not too much, of course, but an India that's just a little bit more equal is better than an India that isn't equal at all. Some concessions here and there, and we should be able to finish the fight and make some real progress!"
 RAJ_Caste_Bargain_Soc_Prog:0 "Social Progress"
 RAJ_Caste_Bargain_Soc_Prog_desc:0 "Upward mobility is important to keep the upper echelons of any society fresh and competitive. Complacency is the enemy, and castes of one kind or another will always exist, so why not just adjust the caste system we have now to allow for mobility between the castes?\n\nThose occupying the Brahmin castes will obviously oppose this, but the Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras all stand to benefit from a change like this, and we'll need their support."
 RAJ_Caste_Bargain_Farm_Sec:0 "Security in Farming"
 RAJ_Caste_Bargain_Farm_Sec_desc:0 "Every time a Dalit or Shudra farm closes due to economic failure, our movement suffers another small blow. All those small blows can do real harm to us if we're not proactive in stopping it, so maybe an expansion of those agricultural safety nets might be in order. Equality cannot just be before the law if it's to be true equality, but also in ability to succeed."
 RAJ_Caste_Bargain_Hindu_Reform:0 "Reform Hinduism"
 RAJ_Caste_Bargain_Hindu_Reform_desc:0 "Hinduism is the majority religion of India, so we can't just take passivity from the pundits forever. If we can get them to agree to help us change the caste system for the better, the process should go a lot more smoothly.\n\nObviously they're going to want something out of the deal, but it can't be worse for us than the damage they could do if they didn't agree."
 RAJ_Caste_Depression:0 "Depression"
 RAJ_Caste_Depression_desc:0 "How long have we been doing this? This damned caste system is like a grindstone, the harder we push against it, the more worn down we get. Pessimism is mounting among the politicians who seemed so excited when we started this journey. How much further can we push this? Is it worth bringing it to its conclusion?"
 RAJ_Caste_Depression_Poor:0 "We Failed the Poor"
 RAJ_Caste_Depression_Poor_desc:0 "We talked the talk, but walking the walk proved to be a lot harder, and the destitute and repressed have a long memory. They won't forget how we stumbled and faltered on delivering on our promises, and now we look like stooges for the Brahmins and Kshatriyas in the eyes of the working Indian man and the farmers."
 RAJ_Caste_Depression_Poor_effect_tt:0 "This will §Rincrease§! the popularity of the §YCommunist Party of India§! among the §Ypoor§! population!"
 RAJ_Caste_Depression_Rich:0 "We Failed the Rich"
 RAJ_Caste_Depression_Rich_desc:0 "The rich of the upper castes remain firmly entrenched in their social status, but our rabble rousing and promises have stirred up sentiments that leave them unsettled and dissatisfied. They've largely interpreted our attempts to bring about equality as an attack on them, so how can we expect their support moving forward?"
 RAJ_Caste_Depression_Rich_effect_tt:0 "This will §Rincrease§! the popularity of the §YBharatiya Jana Sangh§! among the §Yrich§! population!"
 RAJ_Caste_Depression_Religion:0 "We Failed the Religious"
 RAJ_Caste_Depression_Religion_desc:0 "The pundits have not appreciated what they seem to see as "government meddling" in their affairs. And now that the movement looks to be at its lowest point, they are not hesitating to express their displeasure. Hinduism is at the center of life for many Indians, and most will at least listen to what their pundit has to say. It might be that we've made ourselves a very dangerous foe indeed..."
 RAJ_Caste_Depression_Religion_effect_tt:0 "This will §Rincrease§! the popularity of the §YRashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh§! among the §Yreligious§! population!"
 RAJ_Caste_Failure:0 "We Failed India"
 RAJ_Caste_Failure_desc:0 "Reform didn't work. Maybe it was just not enough to do what we wanted it to do. Or maybe it was a pipe dream to start with. Is the caste system just too ingrained in India's DNA to remove? Or maybe we just didn't have the will necessary to do what was needed. But maybe we have one more burst of energy in us..."
 RAJ_Caste_We_Tried:0 "We Tried"
 RAJ_Caste_We_Tried_available_tt:0 "We have decided to market our anti-caste efforts as a success to the population"
 RAJ_Caste_We_Tried_desc:0 "We honestly did what we could, and while the end results have been unfortunate, we can take heart in the fact that history will remember us fondly. Ahead of our times, perhaps, but when has that ever been a bad thing? And in the long run, we have shown that we're willing to fight the good fight, even if the odds are stacked against us."
 RAJ_Caste_Death:0 "Death"
 RAJ_Caste_Death_available_tt:0 "We have decided to outlaw the caste system"
 RAJ_Caste_Death_desc:0 "There is one option left to us. Trying to drum up popular support, pushing incremental legislative support, and trying to change India in a way that wouldn't upset too many people, that all failed. But we can just outlaw it outright, can't we? It might be blunt, crude, almost brutish even, but it's the only option left to us, as far as we can see."
 RAJ_Caste_Acceptance:0 "Acceptance"
 RAJ_Caste_Acceptance_available_tt:0 "We have decided to accept the eternal nature of the caste system"
 RAJ_Caste_Acceptance_desc:0 "Maybe it's just time to admit that, after everything, what we were hoping to do just isn't feasible. If the caste system is ever going to die, it's going to be Father Time who does it, not the works and machinations of mere men. Until then, we just need to come to terms with the fact that the system is just a quirk that is an inherent part of the Indian identity. It may not feel good, but that's just the reality of the situation."

 RAJ_Reestablish_Economy:0 "Reestablish the Economy"
 RAJ_Reestablish_Economy_desc:0 "Now that we have won against the Red Menace and the decadent republic, our first order of business should be the re-organizing of the national economy. Hindutva will need an economy which protects our way of life and ensures the sovereignty of the one true religion, so the Mahaan Pundit will need to choose wisely as to what path we must take."
 RAJ_Listen_to_Guru:0 "Listen to the Mahaan Pundit"
 RAJ_Listen_to_Guru_desc:0 "The always wise and virtuous Guruji, our Great Pundit, has come forth with his plan for the new India. This economy would be almost entirely agrarian, focused entirely on the military and rejecting consumerism. This path is something of a synthesis of the proposals by the RSS and the BJS, meeting the demands of both. Who can say that the Supreme Leader isn't wise?"
 RAJ_RSS_Proposal:0 "The RSS Proposal"
 RAJ_RSS_Proposal_desc:0 "The RSS has come forth with a proposal for the organization of the economy. Rooted in the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi, they argue for a self-reliant economy rooted in agrarian subsidies, tied to the people, and even workers self-management. the BJS have accused the plan of being communistic, and it may not achieve immediate results, but it does have the most public support out of the three plans."
 RAJ_BJS_Proposal:0 "The BJS Proposal"
 RAJ_BJS_Proposal_desc:0 "The BJS has come forth with their proposal for economic development. They have argued for a highly protectionist economy, with most industry being directed and guided by the state. They also support industrialization and have criticized the RSS for it's "socialism in saffron-colored pants". the plan is not exactly popular, but it could give us immediate results."
 RAJ_Integral_Economy:0 "Integral Economy"
 RAJ_Integral_Economy_desc:0 "Our economy must be rooted in Hindu ideas and values. Without it, our uprising would be for naught. Workers must be reminded of their place in society, businessmen must learn to place the state and the sacred in high regards, and foreigners must either learn our culture. As the Mahaan Pundit says, "They must either cease to be foreigners, or may stay in the country, wholly subordinated to the Hindu nation-""
 RAJ_Reject_Consumerism:0 "Reject Consumerism"
 RAJ_Reject_Consumerism_desc:0 "The Western lifestyle of decadence and misery can be traced back to one original sin: consumerism. the belief that one's life can be filled with material goods, and not by the spirit, is one that the English brought over, and is still firmly rooted in our culture. We must root it out, and show the people the bright light that the Mahaan Pundit has bestowed on us, so that our economy may flourish once more."
 RAJ_Eye_of_the_Tiger:0 "Eye of the Tiger"
 RAJ_Eye_of_the_Tiger_desc:0 "The thrill of the fight is not an instinct to be feared or demonized, but to be embraced. To fight for one's country is the highest moral good, and to do so effectively is almost heavenly in its aspiration. This includes not only soldiers and generals, but workers and capitalists as well. Anyone who spends their days making the weapons and bullets our saviour's use to destroy the enemy is just as worthy of praise."
 RAJ_Industry_Swaraj:0 "Swaraj in the Industry"
 RAJ_Industrial_Swaraj_desc:0 "The idea of Swaraj, or self-rule, has a noble origin in the struggle for independence against the colonizers. Now, once again, we fight against those who wish to destroy our nation, but from within. Industry must be downsized, in order to oppose the threat of destroying the pure way of life we have established, and the businessman must be brought to heel for the sake of Hindutva."
 RAJ_National_Dream_of_Fight:0 "National Dream of the Fight"
 RAJ_National_Dream_of_Fight_desc:0 "Our ideals would have been nothing if it were not for the patriots who raised their guns in our name, and expelled the enemy from our lands. This dream of Hinduness must be shared by all, as any difference in public opinion may be dangerous to the preservation of this dream. Soldiers, remain forever vigilant!"
 RAJ_Daily_Struggle:0 "Tackle Daily Struggles"
 RAJ_Daily_Struggle_desc:0 "Our reforms will mean nothing if we do not improve the lives of every person living within our borders, and ensuring that they conform to the laws and ideals of Hindustan. This will be costly, and many may deem our methods brutal and inefficient, but so be it. Our path is righteous, and none may get in the way."
 RAJ_Ghandian_Socialism:0 "Ghandian Socialism"
 RAJ_Ghandian_Socialism_desc:0 "Western conceptions of economics, whether it is liberalism or Marxism, have always been based on what Gandhi called the "multiplication of wants" and the primacy of the individual. Our socialism, however, recognized the primacy of the spirit and the devotion to the nation. As such, we must pursue a policy our nation can be proud of."
 RAJ_Self_Reliance:0 "Self Reliance"
 RAJ_Self_Reliance_desc:0 "During the days of the Empire, India was known as the "Crown Jewel", due to its splendor and greatness. We had this because of our wealth and bounty, not because of outside forces. From this, we have learned that foreign capital is not only not needed, but unwelcome, for we have the resources and strength to maintain our national spirit."
 RAJ_Economy_for_People:0 "An Economy for the People"
 RAJ_Economy_for_People_desc:0 "What would a nation be without its citizens? Nothing! the BJS refuse to recognize this, and deny their sovereignty over all. As such, we recognize the right for workers to, within a limited framework, control their own labour and industry. They may say that this is communism, but we know the truth; this is India!"
 RAJ_Logistics_of_Fighting:0 "Logistics of Fighting"
 RAJ_Logistics_of_Fighting_desc:0 "Wars are costly, not only in the people they take from this world, but in the bullets, guns, tanks, planes and trucks used to fight it. We know from our civil war that any future conflict must be met not by a nation disorganized, but by an army well-supplied and dying to fight again. Let us not make the same mistake twice."
 RAJ_War_Economy:0 "The War Economy"
 RAJ_War_Economy_desc:0 "No war can be fought without food, industry and people. Anyone who thinks otherwise has never seen the true face of war, and will suffer for it. All industry that can be used for war, must be used for war, for the nation depends on it."
 RAJ_National_Economy:0 "A National Economy"
 RAJ_National_Economy_desc:0 "Our industry is far behind the nations that surround us, which puts us in a desperate position. We must meet this challenge head on, and begin the rapid development of heavy industry across the country. This will be met by protests and anger, of course, but they will be thankful later. For now, we must act!"
 RAJ_Increase_Protectionism:0 "Increased Protectionism"
 RAJ_Increase_Protectionism_desc:0 "Our economy is not ready for foreign markets. We simply do not have the goods to trade, or the money to spend. We must instead shelter our economy from outside forces, and focus our intention on building up the economy to a place where we can handle foreign influence and competition."
 RAJ_Economy_National_Interest:0 "An Economy of National Interest"
 RAJ_Economy_National_Interest_desc:0 "As much as the BJS talk about how we don't recognize the importance of the nation, the plans they proposed would have left us weak and open for take-over by external forces. Our nation can only be supreme if we have the industry to support our advances. Only then can the wise words of the Mahaan Pundit be heard throughout our true borders."
 RAJ_Future_Struggles:0 "Prepare for Future Struggles"
 RAJ_Future_Struggles_desc:0 "We must begin our preparation for the future. Our plans are now in motion, and we will soon begin to see their effects. Until then, we cannot rest, and so we must once again re-organize and adapt."
 RAJ_Fascist_New_Economy:0 "The New Indian Economy"
 RAJ_Fascist_New_Economy_desc:0 "At last, we have done it! Against all odds, Hindutva has come out on top, and our way of life has been safeguarded against foreign influence and internal struggle. Our dream has been proven correct, and none can claim otherwise! Long Live India! Long live the Mahaan Pundit!"

 RAJ_Start_the_Government:0 "Restart the Government"
 RAJ_Start_the_Government_desc:0 "We are victorious! the ideals of Hindutva are now sovereign over India. However, we have much work to do; the country must be rebuilt in all matters. In this case, the government must be re-organized, with a new civil service, new laws, and devotion to the Mahaan Pundit. And the question of letting in former politicians and officers is one that will need to be answered quickly."
 RAJ_They_Stay_Out:0 "They Stay Out"
 RAJ_They_Stay_Out_desc:0 "We waged war for the sole purpose of ridding ourselves of the taint left behind by the Republic. the idea that we should let those very corrupting influences right back in is dangerous and counter-productive. They are lucky to be even left alive, and should be thankful that the Mahaan Pundit gave them that much!"
 RAJ_Hinduvta_Propaganda:0 "Hindutva Propaganda"
 RAJ_Hinduvta_Propaganda_desc:0 "Many in India still harbor thoughts and feelings that do not align with the current government. In order to counter this, we will establish a propaganda network; radio stations, tv, posters - anything and everything will be used to push the message that we are righteous and on their side. Hopefully, this can start to convince the apolitical and war-weary, as we work to crack the tougher shells of resistance."
 RAJ_Our_Agriculture:0 "Our Agriculture"
 RAJ_Our_Agriculture_desc:0 "India is, and always will be, agriculturally dominant. Hindustan does not plan on changing that, but with our neighbors seeking to control us more and more, we will need some kind of industry in order to stand up to them. We will need to come to a coherent policy soon in order to meet these issues."
 RAJ_Intelligence_Efforts:0 "Intelligence Efforts"
 RAJ_Intelligence_Efforts_desc:0 "There still exist people who are active in the fight against our dream and the people, and are using subversive tactics in order to do so. In order to combat these threats, extensive spying networks must be established in order to root out spying anywhere it could grow."
 RAJ_Security_Service:0 "Establish the Security Service"
 RAJ_Security_Service_desc:0 "In order to combat our enemies, we will need more than just guns and industry. We will also need an intelligence agency much like the Gestapo or the Kenpeitai, which can rapidly deploy to brutalize and defeat opponents of our government. Harsh? Yes. Necessary? Of course."
 RAJ_Farming_Propaganda:0 "Farming Propaganda"
 RAJ_Farming_Propaganda_desc:0 ""
 RAJ_Status_of_Women:0 "The Status of Women"
 RAJ_Status_of_Women_desc:0 "The question of the role of women is one that needs answering. Many in our government have argued that we must stick to traditional values and keep the gender spheres intact. Others, however, have argued that using women in limited government, economic and military roles could be quite useful in this time. No matter what we pick, we must do so with consideration and haste."
 RAJ_Take_Control:0 "Take Control"
 RAJ_Take_Control_desc:0 "We will need to rapidly re-assert our rule over the nation. Time is of the essence, and by using government bureaucrats and RSS paramilitaries, we can rapidly ensure that order is established and any spontaneous resistance to our rule is quickly done away with."
 RAJ_Control_the_Education:0 "The Education"
 RAJ_Control_the_Education_desc:0 "The Republic's school system promoted the false idols of tolerance, multiculturalism and liberty. In our new age, we must instill a new, more correct system of values, in line with the Mahaan Pundit and Hindutva, which promotes obedience, patriotism and self-sacrifice. That way, we can produce a new generation of soldier-farmers that shall guarantee our nation's stability and long life."
 RAJ_Control_the_Law:0 "The Law"
 RAJ_Control_the_Law_desc:0 "As the Mahaan Pundit tells us, we cannot allow our people to be destroyed or assimilated by foreign actors. We must make our laws inflexible, simple and protective of our people. Curfews, surveillance, the promotion and rewarding of "snitching": all must be done to ensure that those who threaten us are put down like the dogs they are."
 RAJ_Control_the_Administration:0 "The Administration"
 RAJ_Control_the_Administration_desc:0 "None of our reforms can be accomplished without an efficient and patriotic civil service ready to act on those terms. All who apply for government jobs will be tested for loyalty to the state and the Supreme Leader, and members of the civil service will be on the front line in the battle against the issues which plague our great nation."
 RAJ_Saffron_Constitution:0 "The Saffron Constitution"
 RAJ_Saffron_Constitution_desc:0 "Finally, we will need to set these great steps forward in stone, and what better way to do it than a constitution! We shall hold a convention, led by party officials, army establishment, government agents and business leaders in order to draft a constitution which shall be far more efficient, capable and honorable than the Republic of Delhi ever did."
 RAJ_Let_Them_In:0 "Let Them In"
 RAJ_Let_Them_In_desc:0 "In this time of need, we would be foolish to push out those who wish to help us. Yes, some are a bit extreme, but an abundance of enthusiasm is better than no enthusiasm, after all! If they wish to help, we shall happily let them."
 RAJ_SD_Intelligence:0 "Savitri Devi and the Secret Service"
 RAJ_SD_Intelligence_desc:0 "A woman of Greek-French origin, Devi is the founder of ecofascism, has argued that Adolf Hitler was a reincarnation of Vishnu, and that Nazi racial law could be applied to India, with its long history of an established caste system. While her ideas are rather extreme, she has offered to help build our intelligence agency, and her methods on how to do so would be very effective. Let's see what she can do."
 RAJ_SA_Propaganda:0 "A. K. Mukherji and the Political Machine"
 RAJ_SA_Propaganda_desc:0 "The husband of Savitri Devi and a former member of the Azad Hind government, Mukherji has been a consistent supporter of his wife and an open supporter of the struggle against the Republic and the communists. His legacy working for the Azad Hind has put off some, but his legacy in journalism means he knows propaganda well, and his enthusiasm is infectious."
 RAJ_john_thivy:0 "John Thivy and the Expansion of Agriculture"
 RAJ_john_thivy_desc:0 "Originally of Malaysian descent, Thivy has left his country due to the increased popularity of Islam in Bengal and his personal support for fascism. Though his views on race are more akin to Albert Speer in Germany, his knowledge on agriculture and his popularity amongst those who know him are welcome assets."
 RAJ_Establish_Secret_Service:0 "Establish the Secret Service"
 RAJ_Establish_Secret_Service_desc:0 "All wars are doomed to fail if the commander lacks sufficient intelligence. the goal of the Secret Service is to remedy that, by restricting the ability of enemy spies to operate in our territory, and maximizing our influence in theirs. Our eyes will be everywhere, watching and waiting."
 RAJ_National_Rice_Duty:0 "National Rice Duty"
 RAJ_National_Rice_Duty_desc:0 "In order to meet the challenges of poverty and starvation, quotas on rice production must be established so that we can begin to increase productivity on the agricultural front while slowly ending hunger and increasing our popularity."
 RAJ_Patriotic_Women:0 "Patriotic Women"
 RAJ_Patriotic_Women_desc:0 "As the example of Savitra Deli has shown, there are plenty of women who are willing to do what they can to support our government and promote Hinduism in public and private life. We should be willing to work with them, and promote the patriotic duties of motherhood and service."
 RAJ_Help_the_Dalit:0 "Help the Dalit"
 RAJ_Help_the_Dalit_desc:0 "The Dalit, or "The Broken", are the original inhabitants of India kept repressed due to the label of "untouchability", a social death sentence preventing outside contact. If these groups willingly embrace Hinduism, we should welcome them with open arms and promote them as patriotic citizens devoted to the Supreme Leader."
 RAJ_Encourage_Caste_Cooperation:0 "Encourage Caste Coopoeration"
 RAJ_Encourage_Caste_Cooperation_desc:0 "For too long, the castes have been at each other's throats over the most trivial of matters. Though the caste system is not to be tampered with, of course, that does not mean that we must treat each other with disrespect and hostility. We are all citizens of Hindustan, and we must begin to act as such."
 RAJ_Positive_Caste_System:0 "Embrace a Positive Caste System"
 RAJ_Positive_Caste_System_desc:0 "We must acknowledge that everyone has their own role to play; some are workers, some are businessmen. Some are soldiers, some are generals. While the hostility towards one another is not needed, the embracing of one's role in the wheel is, and all must do their part in service for the fatherland."
 RAJ_Government_Established:0 "The Government Established"
 RAJ_Government_Established_desc:0 "We now have beaten back the forces that wished to defeat our hegemony, and have guided the people to victory! Nothing in the world can stop us now!"

 RAJ_Establish_Our_Forces:0 "Establish Our Forces"
 RAJ_Establish_Our_Forces_desc:0 "Now that we have won the civil war, our army must learn from this and begin developing a coherent doctrine on how to organize and fight. If Hindustan is to ever reclaim its rightful lands from the tyrants which threaten it, we must be armed and ready."
 RAJ_Fascist_Army:0 "The New Army"
 RAJ_Fascist_Army_desc:0 "The new world that we have entered into, in all matters, has fundamentally changed, and that includes warfare. the republic and the communists lost because they did not realize this; we must not fall for their naivety."
 RAJ_RSS_Army:0 "RSS Army Doctrine"
 RAJ_RSS_Army_desc:0 "The militias were the key component of our military during the war. Their ability to organize quickly, and strike even quicker, allowed us to exploit key points in their line, much like the Germans during their wars. We should learn from these key experiences, and build upon both popular armies and mechanization in order to achieve victory against our enemies."
 RAJ_BJS_Army:0 "The BJS: Superior Firepower"
 RAJ_BJS_Army_desc:0 "While the militias were certainly useful during the war, that was due to the spontaneous and disorganized nature of our enemies. If we wish to compete against the more modern and developed nations of the world, we will need to mobilize our army in accordance with our economy. That means a focus on centralized command structures and the usage of artillery to evaporate the opposition."
 RAJ_RSS_Fervor:0 "RSS Army Fervor"
 RAJ_RSS_Fervor_desc:0 "As the Mahaan Pundit says, there is nothing wrong with a desire for combat. What is important is that it is directed against our enemies and in service of the virtues. In order to ensure this, commissars will be appointed to every militia unit to ensure that zeal and enthusiasm is maintained within the army, and that anyone who tried to promote false virtues is punished."
 RAJ_RSS_Mass_Mobilization:0 "Mobilize the Masses"
 RAJ_RSS_Mass_Mobilization_desc:0 "What is an army if not the direct expression of the people's will? What is war if not the consciousness of the masses unleashed and enraged? What is death but the liberation of the soul? These truths are essential to are state, and should be the principal of our armies. Only the combined might of the wave after wave of militias shall defeat our enemies."
 RAJ_RSS_Mass_Motorization:0 "Mass Motorization"
 RAJ_RSS_Mass_Motorization_desc:0 "Anyone who has studied the war in Europe knows that mechanization is the key to victory. What, do you think the Germans won by luck? No, they won with speed! We must begin the development of mechanized vehicles in order to ensure our troops can move quickly through weak points and exploit them to our advantage."
 RAJ_RSS_Tank:0 "A Tank for Hindustan"
 RAJ_RSS_Tank_desc:0 "All other modern nations have some form of standard, main battle tank that is easy to be mobilized by the commander of an army. This standard is a good one, and one that we should work towards. If we can quickly develop and produce a sturdy, efficient and powerful tank, we will be a force to be reckoned with."
 RAJ_Rifles_Guns_Cannons:0 "Rifles, Guns, and Cannons"
 RAJ_Rifles_Guns_Cannons_desc:0 "Our boys need weapons to fight with! We must begin a process of weapon standardization to ensure that all units are fully equipped with modern weaponry to meet any challenge the battlefield throws at them."
 RAJ_BJS_Extensive_Planning:0 "Extensive Planning"
 RAJ_BJS_Extensive_Planning_desc:0 "Speed and fervor all good and all, but without a solid plan to back it, it will be all for not. All units should be informed of the details of a battle plan and their role in it, to ensure unity and decisiveness in the destruction of the enemy."
 RAJ_BJS_Officer_School:0 "A New National Officer School"
 RAJ_BJS_Officer_School_desc:0 "An army is only as good as the people who command it. In order to ensure our victories, we need a new military academy, where soldiers will be educated in the theories and tactics of modern western military schools. By doing this, our general staff can go from a mix off bumbling military men and militia renegades, to a regimented, intelligent officer corps."
 RAJ_BJS_Rockets_Missiles:0 "Rockets and Missiles"
 RAJ_BJS_Rockets_Missiles_desc:0 "Oh, the wonders of artillery. Cheaper than tanks, deadlier than guns - what more could an army want? And now, in our new, glorious age, rocket technology has given us many more inventive ways to send our enemies flying to the heavens. Isn't that just dandy?"
 RAJ_BJS_Military_Electronics:0 "Our Own Military Electronics"
 RAJ_BJS_Military_Electronics_desc:0 "Our armies are far behind the Americans, Germans and Japanese in regards to our development of electronics. We should begin modernizing our radios and radar to make sure that we have effective communication between companies and can detect enemy aircraft, ships, missiles, you name it."
 RAJ_Orange_Bannered_Army:0 "Orange-Bannered Army"
 RAJ_Orange_Bannered_Army_desc:0 "Our military reforms are now complete. Whatever path we have taken, we shall be ready to march upon our enemies and assert Hindutva. Forward!"
 RAJ_Fascist_Navy:0 "The New Navy"
 RAJ_Fascist_Navy_desc:0 "With the change in how naval warfare is fought, we have a chance to build up a force that is able to dominate the seas. We should get on that."
 RAJ_RSS_Navy:0 "RSS Navy Doctrine"
 RAJ_RSS_Navy_desc:0 "It would be suicidal to go into this new age expecting for the old methods to work. We should instead focus on developing a navy based around destroyers and submarines, especially nuclear submarines. That way, we can project our power in a way that is stealthy and powerful."
 RAJ_BJS_Navy:0 "BJS Navy Doctrine"
 RAJ_BJS_Navy_desc:0 "It would be suicidal to go into this new age expecting for the old methods to work. Instead of the old days of big battleships and even bigger guns, we should use aircraft carriers and the airwings that accompany them, to ensure that we can control the seas and the skies."
 RAJ_Submarine_Effort:0 "Beneath the Waves"
 RAJ_Submarine_Effort_desc:0 "The ability to sneak into enemy controlled territory undetected and to strike at them with an unmatched ferocity is an enviable ability, and one that we can and should get. By developing submarine technology, we can ensure that our more modern navy can threaten all neighboring forces to ensure they know who they're messing with."
 RAJ_Destroyer_Effort:0 "Decentralized Flotillas"
 RAJ_Destroyer_Effort_desc:0 "As we have learned from the army, a decentralized and mobile force is the doctrine of this new age of speed and fervor. This goes for the navy as well, and a destroyer fleet would be just the thing we need to accomplish this."
 RAJ_Carrier_Effort:0 "A Carrier for India"
 RAJ_Carrier_Effort_desc:0 "Japan, the nation which successfully defeated the US in the Pacific, heavily used aircraft carriers to project their power over even larger distances than before. Just like the US, we should learn from this, and build some carriers to achieve this. Plus, their a great propaganda tool; everyone loves big ships, even when it's wasting taxpayer money!"
 RAJ_Naval_Aviation:0 "Develop Carrier Airwings"
 RAJ_Naval_Aviation_desc:0 "In order to achieve our goal of a carrier-based navy, we will need not only ships, but the aircraft for it. We should do this by developing new planes, repurposing old ones and training a new generation of pilots ready to blow the enemy sky high."
 RAJ_Fascist_Dockyards:0 "New Dockyard Facilities"
 RAJ_Fascist_Dockyards_desc:0 "None of this planning is meaningful if we do not have the dockyards to build these ships. We must begin the development and construction of new dockyards so that our navy can be made as quickly as possible."
 RAJ_Fascist_Naval_Doctrine:0 "Large-Scale Doctrinal Experiments"
 RAJ_Fascist_Naval_Doctrine_desc:0 "In order to train this new generation of sailors, we should begin naval exercises. Much like the land exercises the army uses to train, we can use mock battles in order to show our sailors what combat will look like, and the roles they will play to assert Hindutva on the waves."
 RAJ_Greatest_Navy:0 "The Greatest Navy"
 RAJ_Greatest_Navy_desc:0 "Our navy, while not the size or strength of the super-powers, does have the greatest strength; the ability to adapt. This new age of technology has created a new age of warfare, and Hindustan will be there to meet this challenge and take it like champions. Soon, we shall rule the waves!"
 RAJ_Fascist_Airforce:0 "The New Airforce"
 RAJ_Fascist_Airforce_desc:0 "The war has taught us that without proper air support, our armies will crumble and our dreams will vanquish. To make sure this never happens, we need a plan for our new air force."
 RAJ_RSS_Airforce:0 "RSS Airforce Doctrine"
 RAJ_RSS_Airforce_desc:0 "The Army and the Air Force should be united as one. By using the air force to pounce on weak positions, this gives the army a chance to break through and surround the enemy. This tactic, especially in the age of jets, is one we should use in our future operations."
 RAJ_BJS_Airforce:0 "BJS Airforce Doctrine"
 RAJ_BJS_Airforce_desc:0 "Without industry, infrastructure or people, a nation cannot fight. Our doctrine must recognize this, and focus on the complete obliteration of the homefront to ensure our enemies crumble before us."
 RAJ_Fascist_Fighters:0 "A Homegrown Fighter Design"
 RAJ_Fascist_Fighters_desc:0 "We have no need of foreign designs for our fighters. We have the technology, and we can and should use it. By having a standard fighter for our air force, we can make production more efficient, training easier and combat less deadly for our side."
 RAJ_Paramilitary_Squadrons:0 "Paramilitary Squadrons"
 RAJ_Paramilitary_Squadrons_desc:0 "A military that is loyal and built on the ideals of the nation is one that shall always win. Just like all other branches, pilots should be reinforced with zeal and patriotism, and should always be ready to lay down their lives for the glory of India."
 RAJ_Ace_Training:0 "Ace Training"
 RAJ_Ace_Training_desc:0 "Fighter pilots should learn not only how to assist ground forces, but to dogfight. Without the ability to defend themselves, they are moving targets. This can promote a sense of self-sufficiency and bravery amongst pilots, to ensure that no matter what stress they are under, they can fight effectively and achieve their goals."
 RAJ_Fascist_Airbases:0 "Empower Army Engineers"
 RAJ_Fascist_Airbases_desc:0 "There is nothing quite like the ability to make things explode. the army already does this quite well, and since we'll be doing that soon enough, we should learn from the best. Prior knowledge on building weak points and explosive armaments means that we can better pursue the annihilation of the enemy."
 RAJ_Women_in_Airforce:0 "Women in Aviation"
 RAJ_Women_in_Airforce_desc:0 "We need every pilot we can get in order to build up an effective air force. During the war in Europe, the Soviets recruited women into the air force, and they would serve with honor and distinction against the Germans. Maybe we should do the same."
 RAJ_Stick_to_Traditions:0 "Stick to Traditions"
 RAJ_Stick_to_Traditions_desc:0 "We have other ways of building up an effective air force that doesn't destroy our values. Besides, look how far we've gotten! We've done right so far, we don't need to change, right?!"
 RAJ_Control_the_Skies:0 "Controlling the Skies"
 RAJ_Control_the_Skies_desc:0 "Our Air force reforms are now complete. We have a fully modernized and ready air force, ready to dominate the air and send the enemy pilots roasting in their cockpits. No one can stop us!"

 RAJ_State_of_Crisis:0 "State of the Crisis"
 RAJ_State_of_Crisis_desc:0 "As if the task of rebuilding the nation wasn't hard enough, we now have another crisis on our hand. the RSS has been known for carrying attacks on villages without orders, and now they have gotten into the news for completely levelling a small town filled with innocent people, and not the communist rebels they claimed resided there. We'll need to decide whether to admit to our complicity in this and seek reconciliation, or to suppress this case entirely and blame it on an external force. Get the intelligence reports!"
 RAJ_Fascist_Silence_the_Case:0 "Silence the Case"
 RAJ_Fascist_Silence_the_Case_desc:0 "Our regime needs the RSS, and as humiliating as this case is, we must do what we can to end the protests before it gets out of hand. We will need to at least reprimand and control the RSS from within, so that this doesn't happen again. Along with that, we shall ramp up propaganda efforts to make it seem like a crime committed by anti-fascist forces. Finally, we'll need to ramp up police recruitment and training so that we can control or subdue any protest that emerges in response to this event."
 RAJ_Fascist_Truth_And_Reconcilliation:0 "Truth and Reconciliation"
 RAJ_Fascist_Truth_And_Reconcilliation_desc:0 "The only way to end the state of unrest caused by this event is by apologising and seeking peace between the people. the RSS is a loyal and useful force in our war against degenerate forces, but this kind of behaviour is unacceptable. For now own, the RSS will be strictly regulated by the party, and the men responsible will face justice. This will show the people our innocence and dignity."
 RAJ_Calm_Down_Protestors:0 "Calm Down the Protestors"
 RAJ_Calm_Down_Protestors_desc:0 "The police have already been deployed to watch the streets, so they will be able to maneuver quickly and shut it down before it gains any steam. There may be some arrests, and even some gunshots, but better that than allow an uprising to build enough steam to seriously threaten our regime. This is a necessary evil."
 RAJ_False_Flag:0 "Look! A False Flag!"
 RAJ_False_Flag_desc:0 "The people have no need to be upset. As we have proven with evidence and witness testimony, this is a communist plot by American forces to delegitimize our government! Does that sound good? I sure hope so, this bullshit needs to end quickly, and if that requires some lying, then so be it."
 RAJ_Control_RSS:0 "Control the RSS"
 RAJ_Control_RSS_desc:0 "The fact that this was even allowed to happen is just another reason why the RSS needs to answer directly to us. No one will be reprimanded, sure, but we must make it very clear who they take orders from, and that any further disobedience will be punished severely. Party officials will be monitoring every action by the paramilitaries, to ensure that they act within party guidelines and obey the general staff."
 RAJ_Crisis_Propaganda:0 "Propaganda Effort"
 RAJ_Crisis_Propaganda_desc:0 "In order to keep the peace, we must win back the hearts and minds of the people. TV ads will need to be put in, showing the love and dedication the party shows to India, and nation-wide tours featuring the Mahaan Pundit and other high-ranking party officials should be held. By demonstrating this, we shall show that we are not the out-of-touch elites of the Bombay Republic, but a new class of leader, dedicated to the nation and its ideals."
 RAJ_Three_Arrests:0 "Three Shots, Two Arrests, and One Coffee"
 RAJ_Three_Arrests_desc:0 "We still need a scapegoat for this event, even if we don't plan on having the RSS hung to dry. So, here's the plan; why we have a talk with the officers involved with the attack over some coffee, we'll have some of the privates who participated arrested and shot before the day is done. We could keep it quiet, or even claim that they were the communist insurgents. But regardless, it needs to be done, for the sake of Hindustan."
 RAJ_Police_RSS:0 "Police the RSS"
 RAJ_Police_RSS_desc:0 ""It has been made clear by recent events that the RSS cannot be allowed to simply run amok as bandits and so-called "vigilantes". While we may have cooperated during the conflict that led us here, we cannot forgive their crimes against the Indian people just because of past friendship. We can either watch over the RSS and make sure they are used as a tool for good, or we can just try and get rid of them. I think both sides will agree that the first option is preferable."
 RAJ_Fascist_Issue_Apology:0 "Issue an Apology"
 RAJ_Fascist_Issue_Apology_desc:0 "Much outrage has arisen over this catastrophe the RSS has gotten us into, and people need a greater perpetrator to point at than just a few rogue soldiers. This attack was clearly not our fault, of course, but with no other option it would be best for us to issue an apology on the behalf of the RSS. This will both shift the blame more towards them and away from us and make us look better for acknowledging the issue and trying to at least make amends."
 RAJ_Fascist_Negotiate_Protestors:0 "Negotiate with the Protestors"
 RAJ_Fascist_Negotiate_Protestors_desc:0 "While unrest in the streets is never preferable, we must admit that the people who are crying out against this war crime do have a point. the fact is that innocents were killed, and there was no justification. Perhaps if we open up negotiations with leaders and organizers among the protesters, we can show them that we are doing our best to bring justice to the perpetrators of this horrible crime, and that they should be working with us rather than against us."
 RAJ_No_Connections:0 "We Had No Connections"
 RAJ_No_Connections_desc:0 "Why would anyone want to blame our government for this attack? Our investigations have shown that this band of thugs were acting completely independently and without the sanctioning of anyone higher up. No orders were ever sent to level a village full of innocents, that's for sure. We must show the people that we had no prior knowledge or involvement here."
 RAJ_One_Arrest:0 "One Shot, One Arrest, and No Coffee"
 RAJ_One_Arrest_desc:0 "We have finally come to terms with this event. the officer responsible for ordering this crime has been arrested and replaced, and they will be executed within the hour. Our ability to face the truth and make up for our failures have ingrained respect within the people, and we shall be stronger going ahead because of it. the bearers of truth always win, no matter how tough it gets."
 RAJ_Continue_Operations:0 "Continue Operations"
 RAJ_Continue_Operations_desc:0 "No matter what happens, the show must go on. There are still communist, republican and imperialist partisans in the countryside, lying in wait to strike our forces. We will still need to root out these forces, but we should train our soldiers on anti-partisan warfare in order to ensure that they act more cautiously than the fools who started this mess."
 RAJ_Hire_New_Officers:0 "Hire New Officers"
 RAJ_Hire_New_Officers_dessc:0 "Regardless of what we decide to do, we will need new officers in the RSS. the new officer corp is going to need to be politically reliable, and able to follow orders without question. This, along with the ability to effectively lead their troops into battle, will improve the combat efficiency all around while ensuring that this disaster doesn't happen again."
 RAJ_Guru_on_Radio:0 "Guruji on the Radio"
 RAJ_Guru_on_Radio_desc:0 "In order to ensure that the people remain calm during this period of uncertainty, the Mahaan Pundit will be giving nightly addresses to the people about current affairs and all the ways the party will be working towards making the country a better place to live. It will act as a calm and wise reminder of how much better we have been since the Republic of Bombay has been ousted by our righteous armies."
 RAJ_Fascist_Crisis_Fine:0 "We're Fine!"
 RAJ_Fascist_Crisis_Fine_desc:0 "After all of that, we have finally come out clean. the protestors have dispersed, the RSS has been put under our control, and the people have moved on. Now, we can finally get back to regular policy and ensuring that Hindustan can remain strong and righteous against the forces which seek to topple us."

For a second time, we have brought unity to Hindustan and defeated those who would weaken us. the RSS shall no longer try to thwart us and subvert our sublime ideology, for we have full control! Now we can finally begin to implement our plans to their fullest extent, no longer limited by infighting and games of power. It is time that we can truly begin to realize the full glory of Hindustan and raise it to its proper place in the world."

 RAJ_BJS_Militarize_Police_desc:0 "With the death of the RSS, we need someone to keep the peace of this land, to maintain our law and order, and to crush any resistance to the new national administration. We've always found support in the members of the police force, and as a reward for their loyalty, as well as out of necessity now that we've purged our brawn, we'll arm the police like they're soldiers. This way we can ensure that no pesky partisans could possibly stop our plans to re-energize India's national spirit."
 RAJ_BJS_Government_Purge:0 "Government Purge"
 RAJ_BJS_Government_Purge_desc:0 "There still exist figures in our government who are open in their opposition to our plans. We have no need of their bickering. the police shall round these traitors up and find them more suitable jobs as labourers, subject to the needs and wants of the state. Those positions shall instead be filled with loyal and efficient administrators, who shall work towards achieving our ideas, and not any other."
 RAJ_BJS_Nation_is_Ours:0 "The Nation is Ours"
 RAJ_BJS_Nation_is_Ours_desc:0 "After the arduous struggle to assert our control, we have finally won. the party shall now promote our ideas of an efficient, corporate state, and the nation shall prosper because of it. Huzzah!"
 RAJ_BJS_Establish_Own_Army:0 "Establish Our Own Army"
 RAJ_BJS_Establish_Own_Army_desc:0 "With the RSS no longer a viable or trustworthy force to fight for our ideas, we must establish a true fighting force for Hindustan. This will not be a ragtag group of militias and partisans meant for fighting a civil war but instead a true military force, a well-organized and well-equipped hierarchy of soldiers and officers who will be able to enforce our will and bring honor and glory to our nation. This will be our army, and all would do well to fear it."
 RAJ_BJS_Centralized_Administration:0 "Top-Down Administration"
 RAJ_BJS_Centralized_Administration_desc:0 "We cannot allow our nation to stagnate and be sucked dry by the bureaucracy of the past. If we are to get anything done, we must create an administration that is centralized, powerful, and efficient. This means that those at the top can get what is best for the nation done quickly and without encumberment by tedious and pointless "checks and balances". Anything more and we risk slowing our operations to a point that is not acceptable."
 RAJ_BJS_National_State:0 "The National State"
 RAJ_BJS_National_State_desc:0 "Our principles have recognized that the primary agent in the philosophy of fascism is the state. Without it, we are nothing; we have no armies, no economy, and certainly no united people. We must once again assert the supremacy of the state, as Mussolini says, "Everything within the state, nothing outside it, nothing against it."
 RAJ_BJS_Properly_Setup_Army:0 "Properly Set Up the Army"
 RAJ_BJS_Properly_Setup_Army_desc:0 "Our army needs soldiers! the nation requires that, in order to combat foreign enemies, we shall hold a national draft to ensure that our armies are filled to the brim with patriotic, well-trained warriors ready at a moments notice to defend the fatherland. And remember, service guarantees citizenship, so don't slack, and be ready to be at your local barracks if your number is called!"

 RAJ_BJS_Professional_Army:0 "A Professional Army"
 RAJ_BJS_Professional_Army_desc:0 "An army of militias will not be able to withstand the modern requirements of protracted war. They are too disorganized and inefficient to be sustainable in the long term. Instead, we need a standing army, with a professional corps of officers that can effectively lead our soldiers into conflict. This model shall be far more useful in a modern conflict, and will be proven right in the conflicts to come."
 RAJ_BJS_Crack_Down_Dissent:0 "Crack Down on Dissent"
 RAJ_BJS_Crack_Down_Dissent_desc:0 "There still exist cracks in our mighty wall. Communists, republicans, imperialists, Anti-Communal League associates and even RSS agents still lay in our mists. We should begin organizing the national police and begin raids against anti-patriotic hideouts and villages, to ensure that we never fall to treasonous forces."
 RAJ_BJS_Armed_Expansion:0 "Armed Expansion"
 RAJ_BJS_Armed_Expansion_desc:0 "Our army still needs much more expansion for it to be effective. We need more men, more guns, more tanks, more cannons - everything. In order to act on this deficit, more arms manufacturers shall be established and regulated by the state to ensure that our army has the best equipment, that can be produced quickly to meet any challenge we face."
 RAJ_BJS_Further_Military_Research:0 "Further Military Research"
 RAJ_BJS_Further_Military_Research_desc:0 "We are still years behind most Western nations, and Japan far surpasses us in naval and air technology. We should promote the research of military technologies, possibly by giving scholarships and material benefits to those who give us reliable designs for the future. This shall ensure only the best for our military, and show to the West that we are not something to be laughed at."
 RAJ_BJS_Military_Hour:0 "The Military Hour"
 RAJ_BJS_Military_Hour_desc:0 "Our reforms have done much to make our military stronger. A reliable officer corps, a supply of solid equipment for our soldiers, and a draft ensuring that we never run low on patriotic fighters. We can begin finishing touches to our loyal instruments of the state, ensuring that efficiency and victory is a constant, and does not come from random luck like the militias."
 RAJ_BJS_Watchdog_Peace:0 "Watchdog of Peace"
 RAJ_BJS_Watchdog_Peace_desc:0 "Our armies exist not as blunt instruments to beat in the heads of the opposition, but as defenders of order and protectors of our sovereignty.

Parades, demonstrations, speeches; all shall be done to show that we are no longer the Jewel of the Empire, but the Mighty Lion of the Orient. They must never forget that."

Our leaders may be born of combat, but they shall be conceived in these academies."

 RAJ_BJS_State_Economy_desc:0 "We know what's best for Hindustan, and the economy is no exception to that. If it is to operate efficiently and in a way that brings prosperity to the people of our nation, then we must step in and take direct control in much the same manner we have with other processes of the country. This move may prove to be controversial among some, but they will come to thank us for our diligent efforts to bring lasting success to our economy."
 RAJ_BJS_Expand_National_Schools:0 "Expand National Schools"
 RAJ_BJS_Expand_National_Schools_desc:0 "Education has always proved to be most important when a nation needs more good, dedicated workers. A smart citizen will learn new trades faster and be able to do a wider variety of jobs without fail. To this end, we will grant more funding to our education programs so that students across the nation will be better prepared to become hard-working and dedicated citizens of Hindustan."
 RAJ_BJS_Planned_Economy:0 "A Planned Economy"
 RAJ_BJS_Planned_Economy_desc:0 "Each and every aspect of our nation's markets must be carefully examined and optimized if we are to truly realize the potential of a centralized and state-run economy. From the largest businesses to the smallest local shops, all should be factored in as gears in the massive machine that is our economy. All must report to us and submit to us when we demand change. If even a single gear comes loose, the machine can become less efficient or even screech to a halt."

 RAJ_BJS_Military_Schools_desc:0 "Our efforts to establish military academies have already been quite successful. Our officers are coming out smarter than they ever have before, but this isn't enough. the machine that is the state requires all parts to work well, and that includes even the tiniest cogs. Every soldier must be educated in small-team tactics, large operations, history and patriotic values, so that we mustn't need to worry about the quality of drafted troops at large."
 RAJ_BJS_Work_For_Students:0 "Work for the Students"
 RAJ_BJS_Work_For_Students_desc:0 "he intrepid youth of our nation should not be left out of the grand cause of the new society. Our youth branches and organizations have proven that the students of Hindustan are just as eager to serve the new state as any other, and to leave them out would be a disservice to both them and us. Let us include them going forward with student organizations and youth groups that allow them to spread our glorious cause."
 RAJ_BJS_National_Resource_Agency:0 "National Resource Agency"
 RAJ_BJS_National_Resource_Agency_desc:0 "All industries need raw goods to function, state-planned or not. India is a massive and plentiful land filled with endless natural resources, and now that we have centralized the industries that rely on those resources we should take direct control of the management of our nation's bounties. If the entire supply chain is under our guiding hand, then we will become just that much more efficient."
 RAJ_BJS_Wealth_Factories:0 "Wealth Factories"
 RAJ_BJS_Wealth_Factories_desc:0 "A national economy is important for the wellbeing of the state. Our industry must be expanded, so that the home market can be stronger, and our nation more self-reliant. Unlike the republic of old, we have no need of handouts from foreign powers. Our own strength will suffice in the task of ensuring that our people are well-fed, and our armies supplied with the best gear."
 RAJ_BJS_State_Healthcare:0 "State Healthcare"
 RAJ_BJS_State_Healthcare_desc:0 "Another thing we must take control of to ensure the health and safety of our citizens is our nation's doctors and hospitals. Too many languish without proper care, and dying people are rejected from treatment because they cannot pay or because there are not enough beds. This is a complete disgrace, and as the people's government we must step in and provide these services free of charge. Every citizen has more than earned free care through their hard work and dedication to Hindustan."
 RAJ_BJS_State_Infrastructure:0 "State Infrastructure"
 RAJ_BJS_State_Infrastructure_desc:0 "So many rural villages and towns still lack proper roads and paths even this far into the 20th century. Our nation is a single body, and our people are its blood, but we will be a sick nation if there are no veins for the blood to flow! We shall construct railroads, streets, sidewalks, bridges, tunnels, and more, so that any citizen can travel from one end of the country to the other without facing difficult paths that have not been maintained for decades."
 RAJ_BJS_Labour_University:0 "Labour University"
 RAJ_BJS_Labour_University_desc:0 "In order to meet the problems of a lack of skilled labourers, we shall establish numerous universities with the goal of giving workers the skills they need to find a well-paying job. Instead of relying on the labour of foreigners, we can supply our own loyal and intelligent labourers, which can decrease unemployment and raise the standard of living. We can't complain with results like that."
 RAJ_BJS_Expand_Everything:0 "Bollywood of the Nation"
 RAJ_BJS_Expand_Everything_desc:0 "The Germans were the first to seriously realize how useful film could be in spreading our ideas. Many Bollywood directors and actors have supported us in the past, and are willing to make films that promote our values. Instead of decadent, pornographic filth, our new industry shall show the virtues of patriotism, chastity, loyalty and courage against impossible odds. the West shall find this disgusting and say that it crushes freedom, but what do they know? They have their own Hollywood to do the same!"
 RAJ_BJS_Its_the_State:0 "It's the State" #shrugging_emoji.jpg
 RAJ_BJS_Its_the_State_desc:0 "In the corners of houses and in alleyways, in untamed jungles and old hideaways, voices speak in whispers of the BJS. They ask and wonder such small-minded things as "What of the RSS?" or "What of us?" They can't see the bigger picture. They can't see the greatness of the BJS and of India. They hear of our growing power and find in their hearts and minds an animalistic fear when the proper reaction should be that of love and joy. It doesn't matter now. To cement our power and to further the national interest, we can't heed such petty thoughts and feelings. No! We must be cutthroat and forward thinking, and if that means that pestilent children shall say oh so nasty words about us behind our backs, so be it!\n\nWe're taking power and taking names. They might think us devils or villains, but it doesn't matter because at the end of it all they'll be singing our praises. For now they think that their heroes are the men with guns who serve the traitorous RSS, but no, their true hero, it's the state."
 RAJ_BJS_Secret_Research:0 "Secret Research"
 RAJ_BJS_Secret_Research_desc:0 "As a rising power, we need an arsenal to match. Bombs, weapons, and technologies beyond many peoples' wildest dreams will all be necessary for us to be a true power. However, there are other nations and even those within our own government who would do best to not know about these new technologies. If they were to be known to the public, other powers would react and try to crush us before we could complete their development! We cannot let this happen. We will have to keep most of this secret until we unleash it in a blaze of fire and fury against our foes!"
 RAJ_BJS_Blazing_Glory:0 "Blazing Glory"
 RAJ_BJS_Blazing_Glory_desc:0 "From miles away, our guns will strike. Artillery will pound the foe into dust and leave the survivors unable to respond. These will be massive guns that demonstrate the strength and power of our state, weapons to rip holes in the enemy and shred their morale. This shall be the greatest artillery in all of Asia, and we alone shall wield such unbridled strength!"
 RAJ_BJS_Invisibility_Cloak:0 "Invisibility Cloaks"
 RAJ_BJS_Invisibility_Cloak_desc:0 "Ghosts in the air, phantoms under the sea. Stealth technology will allow us to strike quickly and leave our foes not knowing what hit them. the enemy cannot fight back against what he cannot see, and we will demonstrate that with our stealth aircraft that will fly invisible and silent above the earth, bringing death from all directions to those who will challenge us. They shall be specters of death in the air, and we shall be the ones who command them!"
 RAJ_BJS_Electronic_Research:0 "RADAR and Radioes"
 RAJ_BJS_Electronic_Research_desc:0 "Communication and detection may not be exciting as superweapons that bring flame and anguish to millions, but for our purposes they will likely end up being far more useful. Ensuring proper dialogue in the military is necessary for plans in distant regions to be properly carried out, and knowing where the foe lies always keeps you one step ahead. Our research into these topics will certainly yield many breakthroughs and put us on par with future enemies."
 RAJ_BJS_State_Power_One_Bomb:0 "State Power in One Bomb"
 RAJ_BJS_State_Power_One_Bomb_desc:0 "The atomic bomb is the weapon of the modern era. the power to annihilate cities and entire nations compacted into a single bomb, ready to be unleashed on any foe foolish enough to try and challenge its wielder. It is the pinnacle of destruction, and any nation that has even one gains unfathomable strength and authority on the world stage. the ability to end millions is one that we must have, lest we be forgotten as a 'regional power.'"
 RAJ_BJS_Government_Expansion:0 "Government Expansion"
 RAJ_BJS_Government_Expansion_desc:0 "Our reach is severely limited after the chaos of the civil war and the consolidation of power that followed. Officials were killed or purged and entire systems were destroyed or made obsolete. We need to shore up our new government. We will bring in loyal servants, rebuild government buildings, and bring our reach even farther than the old government ever dared. Only through radical expansion can we rebuild our power and bring our authority to the entire country."
 RAJ_BJS_Mandatory_Party_Membership:0 "Madatory Party Membership"
 RAJ_BJS_Mandatory_Party_Membership_desc:0 "Our party runs the state, and the state runs the people. Thus, it logically follows that the state runs the people, for their own good of course. To make this process simpler, every man, woman, and child should be required to be a member of the party. This will streamline many processes as well as make it easier for us to find traitors and subversives. Some will complain, but that will just make it easier for us to find and get rid of them. One party, one people, one state."
 RAJ_BJS_Integrated_Military_Police:0 "Integrated Military Police"
 RAJ_BJS_Integrated_Military_Police_desc:0 "Our police force must not only be strong and well-equipped, it must also answer directly to us. We cannot let justice be encumbered by endless paperwork and pointless layers between us and the enforcers of peace. If they are to enforce the law, the police must have the proper tools and weapons, and we must be able to provide them. No more criminals running free because of weak police and endless 'checks and balances'. We need a force that brings order and safety, not one that brings long lines and boredom."
 RAJ_BJS_More_Purges:0 "Further Purges"
 RAJ_BJS_More_Purges_desc:0 "Despite our greatest efforts, our state is plagued by the corruption and disloyalty of the former government and the RSS. While we wish there was a better answer, the only thing we can do is continue to cleanse our ranks and keep our government sanitary and loyal. It may take a long time, but at some point we will have finally rid our state of traitors. Until then, we can only get down and do the dirty work."
 RAJ_BJS_Religious_Reform:0 "Religious Reform"
 RAJ_BJS_Religious_Reform_desc:0 "We are a Hindu nation. This is an eternal and holy fact that none can dispute. However, while Hinduism is the one faith of India, India is not the one state of Hinduism. It is time we correct that. Just as the faith is deeply intertwined with the Indian state, soon the State will be integral and inseparable from the faith. Religious officials, mandatory conversions, perhaps even a centralized system of churches run by the government, these and more will marry nation and religion so that they can never again be removed from each other."
 RAJ_BJS_Administrative_Reform:0 "Administrative Reform"
 RAJ_BJS_Administrative_Reform_desc:0 "Ah, bureaucracy. That ever-present demon that spells the downfall of countless governments. Home of corruption, plotting, disobedience, betrayal, and everything else that turns the state from a well-oiled machine to a steaming mess of gears and money. the old government leaned on bureaucracy like a crippled man leans on a cane. We will not make the same mistake. We will tear the system down and rebuild it with only three goals: efficiency, authority, and loyalty. Any more complicated and cracks begin to open for the rats and worms to scuttle in."
 RAJ_BJS_Judiciary_Reform:0 "Judiciary Reform"
 RAJ_BJS_Judiciary_Reform_desc:0 "The judges and courts of our new state will be extraordinarily vital in ensuring justice is carried out and that order is maintained. However, we have to make sure that these judges interpret the laws the way that we meant for them to be interpreted. We will have to keep a close eye and build a whole new framework that will let us manage the judiciary properly. If we let them run free, our judges will fall to ideology, corruption, and all the other things that cause a nation's system of justice to fall apart. the new system will have proper supervision and prevent the miscarriages of justice so common in 'democratic' nations."
 RAJ_BJS_Government_Reform:0 "Governmental Reform"
 RAJ_BJS_Government_Reform_desc:0 "The old government infrastructure was simply not designed to handle the strength and centralization of the new state. We simply can't use the old systems if we want to rule efficiently and spread our will quickly. We will reform it from the very foundations so that our authority can not be hindered. Every aspect will be rebuilt, every official retrained or replaced. the new government will be the greatest this nation has ever seen!"
 RAJ_BJS_Unity_in_Religion:0 "Unity in Religion"
 RAJ_BJS_Unity_in_Religion_desc:0 "Hinduism is a massive and fragmented faith, having diverged over millennia in every region and town. Many villages have deities and spirits that are just as important in the local tradition as any of the major deities. As regrettable as it is, we must crack down on this fragmentation. If we are to be one nation and one people, then we can only have one faith, and that faith must be as strong and united as every other aspect lest the whole thing fall apart."
 RAJ_BJS_End_Non_Hinduism:0 "End Non-Hinduism"
 RAJ_BJS_End_Non_Hinduism_desc:0 "For centuries, outsiders and unbelievers have attacked us and undermined us. Buddhism and Jainism amount to misguided offshoots at best and sinister betrayal at worst, while foreign faiths like Islam and Christianity constitute invaders who wish to destroy and subvert our ancient and holy culture. Hinduism is deeply tied with the soul of our nation, and no other religion, faith, or church can be tolerated here. We offer one final choice: convert, or face the consequences."
 RAJ_BJS_National_Welfare:0 "National Welfare Programs"
 RAJ_BJS_National_Welfare_desc:0 "We must never forget that we are a nation of the common man, of the poor and hard-working masses. They fought so that this vision of a nation united could be achieved, a country brought together under a single faith as a single people. They are our lifeblood, and we must ensure their security and comfort if we as a nation are to be whole and healthy. This means lifting the loyal masses out of poverty, keeping our citizens off the streets, and allowing all to serve the whole to the best of their ability. Through good welfare programs, we can achieve these goals."
 RAJ_BJS_Regulate_Agriculture:0 "Regulated Agriculture"
 RAJ_BJS_Regulate_Agriculture_desc:0 "Our land is fertile and bountiful, every inch blessed by the gods to be perfectly suited for growing plentiful and healthy crops. However, after decades of mismanagement by foreign oppressors and then by a corrupt government, our nation's agriculture is sorely lacking. the British were focused on growing cotton and other crops that could be used solely for profit, and the government after them did little to fix the poor situation that left us with. To correct this, we will have to step in and reevaluate how our nation's agricultural resources are distributed. New laws and regulations on what can be farmed, how to grow it, and where it can be grown will bring efficiency and order to a system that was once used to exploit us."
 RAJ_BJS_Discriminatory_Care:0 "Discriminatory Care"
 RAJ_BJS_Discriminatory_Care_desc:0 "Our systems for making sure our people are healthy and productive are great in theory, but if they are to reach their maximum potential then we will have to make sure that they are only available to those who deserve them. Those who reject our new government and shun the one true faith should not benefit from the bounties our new state provides. Unbelievers, rebels, the scum of society, all of them! If they don't support our nation then we won't support them!"
 RAJ_BJS_Staple_Food_Initiative:0 "Staple Food Initiative"
 RAJ_BJS_Staple_Food_Initiative_desc:0 "In our efforts to make our nation's agriculture more efficient and beneficial to our people, it has become clear that too much time and money is dedicated to cash crops that take up huge amounts of space and resources while feeding very few. We must realign our focus so that we are primarily growing things that can feed many without costing too much for either the grower or the purchaser. This means wheat, rice, maize, potatoes, and other such crops. We must put our citizens' well-beings before the luxury of elites and foreigners."
 RAJ_BJS_Stability_in_Authority:0 "Stability in Authority"
 RAJ_BJS_Stability_in_Authority_desc:0 "A strong hand is a steady hand. Our country has been wracked by instability for decades now because none had the will to slam down an iron fist and bring order. Too concerned with their warped and twisted versions of 'liberty' and freedom', they were unwilling to bring together the country with strength, and because of that our nation collapsed into civil war. We will never let that happen again. We will not force our people to shed the blood of their brethren ever again. Through a united, centralized, and powerful state, we will make sure that every citizen is safe and that none plot to harm us."
 RAJ_BJS_Diplomatic_Division:0 "Diplomatic Division"
 RAJ_BJS_Diplomatic_Division_desc:0 "With our rule internally solidified, we must now look outwards and find our place on the world stage. We are a massive and powerful country, and we have the potential to establish ourselves as a power on the same level as Japan, America, or the Reich. However, to reach these lofty goals, we will have to make sure that these more established powers recognize us and can communicate with us. We also have to make sure that we can have a proper dialogue with the lesser nations that will follow us. To this end, we must educate and hire a great deal of diplomats and generally work on our world reputation."
 RAJ_BJS_Look_East:0 "Look East"
 RAJ_BJS_Look_East_desc:0 "After the war and our hard-earned freedom, we were faced with a new threat: Japan. Having seized the easternmost reaches of our country, Japan has dominated our eastern front ever since we gained independence. However, we may now finally have our opportunity to reclaim what is rightfully ours. the dragon grows sicker and sicker by the day, while we only gain in strength and reputation. It is time we turn towards the rising sun and reestablish our place as a true force in Asia."
 RAJ_BJS_Look_West:0 "Look West"
 RAJ_BJS_Look_West_desc:0 "From the final strongholds of 'democracy' across the Atlantic to the iron realms of Europe, from the turbulent lands of Africa to our near-neighbors like Iran and the middle east, the west is where many of our diplomatic opportunities will lie. Even closer to home, nations like Pakistan and Afghanistan try to defy us and deny our rightful rule over our territory, traitors to a united subcontinent. No longer. We now face west and ready both our pens and our swords."
 RAJ_BJS_Claim_Bengal:0 "Reunite India"
 RAJ_BJS_Claim_Bengal_desc:0 "Though we have never officially stopped claiming Bengal as an integral part of our territory, the past administration did little to actually enforce that claim. We cannot let this be the situation any longer. the traitors who kneel to the Japanese should no longer feel safety from the fact that the sickened giant protects their collaborationist government, nor should their protectors dismiss us as a non-threat. It is time we take a stand: Bengal is our rightful land!"
 RAJ_BJS_Claim_Nepal:0 "Nepal is Hindu"
 RAJ_BJS_Claim_Nepal_desc:0 "When the British came from across the seas and unjustly cut up and conquered our nation, Nepal was left out for reasons completely arbitrary. Now that we are free and united once more, we must address the fact that Nepal's status as an independent state is nothing but a remnant of British colonialism. Nepal is an essential part of Hindustan, and we should finally take action to enforce that truth."
 RAJ_BJS_Claim_Suleiman:0 "Lands Beyond the Sulaiman Range"
 RAJ_BJS_Claim_Suleiman_desc:0 "Afghanistan is another part of our nation that was not included when the British divided and conquered us. Because of the so-called "great game" between the Russians and the English, the lands beyond the Sulaimans were never fully conquered by either side and thus left out of our new nation when we finally regained our freedom. If that weren't bad enough, those traitors chose to invade and seize our rightful land rather than rejoin their rightful masters. It is time we push back and take back what was stolen and then more."
 RAJ_BJS_Claim_Pakistan:0 "Pakistan Belongs to Us"
 RAJ_BJS_Claim_Pakistan_desc:0 "One of the greatest losses of the civil war was our lands to the west, now controlled by the rogue state of Pakistan. It is known to all that the very river that our subcontinent is named for, the Indus, lies in this rebel nation, and none but the traitors would dispute our rightful and natural claim to those lands! the people of Pakistan are indisputably Indian, and their extended rebellion must now be crushed. the traitors will be brought back into the fold for their own good."
 RAJ_BJS_Claim_Burma:0 "Our Ancient Claims on Burma"
 RAJ_BJS_Claim_Burma_desc:0 "Yet another of our realms lost in the chaos following the days when we threw off the chains of our oppressors, Burma was conquered by our new foes, the Japanese. Following in the footsteps of the British, the beast from the east seized control over Burma, and as history has always shown men to do, rats and cowards chose to bend the knee and act as collaborators. Now, it is our time to liberate the common men and women of this eastern part of our realm from those who would deny our just claim. We will welcome Burma into the fold once more."
 RAJ_BJS_Akhand_Bharat:0 "Akhand Bharat"
 RAJ_BJS_Akhand_Bharat_desc:0 "Though we have faced endless hardship, we know our goal is not a mere dream. It is more than just a plan or our idea. It is now our destiny. A nation united, hundreds of millions of individuals brought together as one people. A single realm, stretching from Kabul to Rangoon. Our natural borders finally achieved, we will be greater than any other nation, as we were always meant to be. That is what we are meant to achieve. That is our destiny: Akhand Bharat."
 RAJ_BJS_US_Investments:0 "Paranoid Investments"
 RAJ_BJS_US_Investments_desc:0 "In order to ensure that our sovereignty is protected, we need to show America that we intend to overpower them as well. This will not be through pure brute force, but through economic matters. Investments in foreign business and the promotion of Indian companies on American soil can ensure that those who wish to help us will, and those that don't stay out of our way."
 RAJ_BJS_US_Wiretapping:0 "Mutual Wiretapping"
 RAJ_BJS_US_Wiretapping_desc:0 "It's been confirmed by some of our sources that American spies have been listening in on our conversations. Wires are being tapped into, meaning that they know what we are saying. This isn't horrible; for one thing, we just need to speak carefully. More importantly, it gives us an excuse to tap them, and listen in more closely on what they don't want us to know."
 RAJ_BJS_US_Alliance:0 "A Shaky Alliance"
 RAJ_BJS_US_Alliance_desc:0 "As stated before, our interests in each other are not built on ideas of love and humanitarianism, but the cold calculations of political necessity. As much as we could not care for them, an alliance with them means keeping the Japanese off our backs, and if that's what it takes to survive an age of nuclear hellfire, then so be it. A toast to our American friends! Let us pray for their success, so we may rid of them as soon as possible!"

Now we can finally do away with all that was holding his vision back and have some real fun."

So rarely is a single document so powerful, and so rarely will we ever have such an opportunity to change so much by doing so little. It is time to take control of the constitution and rewrite it so it better fits the Mahaan Pundit's vision of a glorious India."

With enough power, you can spend it without losing it. It also, unlike money, disappears if it is not used, for he who does not exercise his power has no true power at all.

 RAJ_Guru_Reform_Force_desc:0 "If we want the military to the the Mahaan Pundit's will most efficiently, it needs to be reformed. Better doctrines, loyal officers, good equipment, and more will all be necessary so that they can be a real and formidable fighting force. Anything less and we make ourselves weak, risking allowing our opponents to throw us into another civil war. We can never let that happen."
 RAJ_Guru_Unite_Shakhas:0 "Unite the Shakhas"
 RAJ_Guru_Unite_Shakhas_desc:0 "The Shakhas have been our lesser branches scattered across the country, bringing people far and wide to our cause. However, this local focus on each has led to a good bit of fragmentation, and each one has become something of its own little entity. We have to reunite them and make sure they all remember that they only serve one purpose: to bring all Indians to the light of the Mahaan Pundit. If they resist, they clearly no longer serve us and must be abolished. We are sure they will prefer loyalty."
 RAJ_Guru_Loyalty_Key:0 "Loyalty is Key"
 RAJ_Guru_Loyalty_Key_desc:0 "Some nations have put questionably loyal people in positions of power due to their great ability. We will not make that mistake. No matter a man's ability, he must be able to prove complete and utter loyalty to the Mahaan Pundit and his cause, or else he is of no use to us. He may even be a threat that has to be dealt with. For any who wish to serve us, we welcome you, but remember: loyalty is key."
 RAJ_Guru_Begin_Purge:0 "The Purge Begins"
 RAJ_Guru_Begin_Purge_desc:0 "So many tried to stop my rise. So many plotted and hid in the shadows, praising me in public while privately planning their own rise power. No more. the communists and traitors may be defeated, but there remain so many enemies within our own ranks. I alone know the path for our country, and I cannot allow the countless rats on my own ship to keep hanging on. It is time I rid us of them. Fun is not something one considers when balancing the nation, but this does put a smile on my face."
 RAJ_Guru_Fill_Vacancies:0 "Fill Vacancies"
 RAJ_Guru_Fill_Vacancies_desc:0 "Though it is certainly a great triumph each time a disloyal rat is removed from his office, every time we do so we also empty a position that was useful to our nation. the entire reason we are conducting this purge is because an office held by a traitor is detrimental to the government's health, but an office held by nobody is no more useful to us! We are going to have to fill those posts again. There are certainly many eager to serve the Mahaan Pundit, but we have to make sure they are totally loyal so that we don't have to get rid of them as well."
 RAJ_Guru_New_Officers:0 "New Officers"
 RAJ_Guru_New_Officers_desc:0 "The military was no exception when it came to our purge, and as we cleanse our ranks we are forced to get rid of even the commanders and generals who served us in the civil war. With each officer purged, a large swathe of soldiers is left without proper command, and a military with no proper command is no military at all. We will have to recruit heavily from our soldiers and from military schools so that we can properly replace all of the higher-ups that we are forced to remove."
 RAJ_Guru_Continue_Purge:0 "The Purge Continues"
 RAJ_Guru_Continue_Purge_desc:0 "Like a monstrous hydra, for every disloyal traitor that we cleanse from our ranks, two more seem to be revealed. the depths of disloyalty within the self-proclaimed followers of the Mahaan Pundit have proven to be far worse than we imagined. We will have to keep the purge going, for India cannot be strong and united with corruption and disloyalty in our ranks. We can only hope that our efforts will prove fruitful and that every last rat will be purged."
 RAJ_Guru_Organize_Religion:0 "Organize the Religion"
 RAJ_Guru_Organize_Religion_desc:0 "The Hindu faith is unique in its paradoxical state of both unity and fragmentation. On the on hand, it is one of the most diverse religions in the world, with deities, rituals, and ideas varying wildly across the continent. On the other hand, it is united because even though other faiths would have long since diverged with Hinduism's level of diversity, it still remains a single faith whose followers all accept each other, for the most part. If we can harness that unity, heal the fragmentation, and make it all intertwined with the state, we would control one of the most powerful spiritual tools in history."
 RAJ_Guru_Draft_Reforms:0 "Draft the Reforms"
 RAJ_Guru_Draft_Reforms_desc:0 "The state and everything it entails is now under control. However, power is nothing if you do not use it! Those who take power and hoard it like rich misers are the most pathetic men the world has to offer. It is time we exercise our authority and actually bring real reforms to the subcontinent. With the constitution in our hands and the lawmakers all answering directly to the Mahaan Pundit, there are none who can stop his righteous reforms!"
 RAJ_Guru_Question_of_RSS:0 "The Question of the RSS"
 RAJ_Guru_Question_of_RSS_desc:0 "The RSS has been something of a mixed bag for us. On the one hand, they were the Mahaan Pundit's own organization and many within it served him well on his rise to power. However, it is also dysfunctional and filled with people who would stab anyone in the back for some quick gain. Now we are at a crossroads: we can either attempt to reform the RSS and encourage the loyal and useful elements, or we can finally rid ourselves of the failing organization and replace it with something better."
 RAJ_Guru_Draft_Vigilantes:0 "Draft Vigilantes"
 RAJ_Guru_Draft_Vigilantes_desc:0 "We cannot do everything just yet, but luckily for us the loyal commoners who follow the Mahaan Pundit have stepped in to help with the little details while he works on the big picture. Vigilante gangs have sprung up all over India, dealing out street justice in the name of the Mahaan Pundit. They are already working for us indirectly, and we are always in need of new policemen and soldiers. Perhaps we should grant them some real official authority and funding and bring them into the fold?"
 RAJ_Guru_Coal_in_Furnace:0 "[RAJ_Coal_in_the_Furnace_Change] in the Furnace"
 RAJ_Guru_Coal_in_Furnace_desc:0 "As we solidify our control further, some are wondering if we'll start to slow down and settle in soon. What fools! the Mahaan Pundit's enlightened reign has just begun, and we have only seen the tip of the iceberg of what he has planned for India! His purges will only grow harsher so that all traitors can be wiped from the earth! His policies will only become more efficient and encompass even wider swathes! Let us all cheer for the Mahaan Pundit, let us scream for joy as the flames grow higher!"
 RAJ_Coal_in_the_Furnace_Change_NoDevi_loc:0 "Coal"
 RAJ_Coal_in_the_Furnace_Change_Devi_loc:0 "Gold"
 RAJ_Guru_Convince_Religious:0 "Lead the Religious"
 RAJ_Guru_Convince_Religious_desc:0 "The Mahaan Pundit is the beacon of faith that leads us forwards, and so all who are faithful must bow to his will! Let the common faithful know that he is a holy figure, nearly divine in his purity. Let them be in awe of his aura, let them bow before his holy spirit. Let the followers of the gods all bow to him, for he is the embodiment of faith itself! There is only the Mahaan Pundit, and he is our shield and protector."
 RAJ_Guru_Convince_Rich:0 "Sway the Rich"
 RAJ_Guru_Convince_Rich_desc:0 "The rich of India are very wary after all that has happened. the socialists and communists wished to take all that they had and even get rid of the caste system! We have to assure them that we will keep India strong and traditional and that they would do best to support our regime. There is a purge going on, after all. We wouldn't want any of them to get hurt, now would we?"
 RAJ_Guru_Convince_Poor:0 "Agitate the Poor"
 RAJ_Guru_Convince_Poor_desc:0 "The common folk of India were the ones who truly brought us victory! They fought for us as soldiers and allowed the Mahaan Pundit to bring faith and justice to our nation! But common people, the fight is not over! Corruption and deceit still hide in our ranks, and we are under constant threat from the unfaithful and the hateful! Never let your guard down, Indians! the fight has only just begun!"
 RAJ_Guru_Purge_Speeds_Up:0 "The Purge Gains Speed"
 RAJ_Guru_Purge_Speeds_Up_desc:0 "So many traitors, so many corrupt rats! This is ridiculous, how could we have ever let it get this bad? It is reaching a point where we have to purge those who we brought in to replace those we purged! They hide at every level of government, trying to take us down from the inside for their own insidious purposes. We just can't seem to get them all. We clearly need to push harder, cut the weed before it can grow any faster!"
 RAJ_Guru_Military_Priesthood:0 "Military Priesthood"
 RAJ_Guru_Military_Priesthood_desc:0 "We have tied faith deeply into our state, and we have intertwined the military just as much, but we have yet to unite those two together. What if we were to combine these as well? We would create something unseen in the history of man, a perfect union of all aspects of our nation. A Holy Trinity of our own: state, faith, and military."
 RAJ_Guru_Conquer_Hinduism:0 "The Conquest of Hinduism"
 RAJ_Guru_Conquer_Hinduism_desc:0 "Hinduism is a great beast. So strong, so wild, so unwilling to be tamed. No more! We will become the masters of the Hindu religion for its own good. Seize the churches, organize the priesthood, tie it so inseparably from us that it will never be an entity without us ever again! We will embark on something never seen in the history of India, the Conquest of Hinduism!"
 RAJ_Guru_Fill_More_Vacancies:0 "Continue Filling Vacancies"
 RAJ_Guru_Fill_More_Vacancies_desc:0 "The depths that we have reached with this purge could never have been imagined before we started. Who knew that there were so many traitors in our ranks? We can hardly replace them quick enough. Scratch that, we can't replace them quick enough! We need to get loyal officers and government workers anywhere we can! Recruit directly from the schools, bring in family members, anything! You there, do you know how to read? How does being governor sound?"
 RAJ_Guru_Reenforce_Castes:0 "Reenforce the Castes"
 RAJ_Guru_Reenforce_Castes_desc:0 "The caste system has brought order and efficiency to India for millenia. Each person knows their place and serves where society needs them most. However, after the chaos of the civil war and all the ideological nonsense that was thrown around, people in the lower castes started to get some ideas. They wanted to rise above their rightful place and greedily seize from those above them! We can allow it no longer. We have to enforce the system."
 RAJ_Guru_Kebata:0 "The KeBata"
 RAJ_Guru_Kebata_desc:0 "We need better intelligence. So many who would sabotage the Mahaan Pundit have slipped through the cracks! We need an organization, one that can watch over us properly, one that can find the traitors more quickly, one that can do the dirty work quickly and efficiently. They will rival the Kenpeitai and the SS and the FBI, and they shall never fail us! They will be our Saffron Battalions, a phantom authority that will triumph over all that would try to destroy our Mahaan Pundit's vision!"
 RAJ_Guru_Religious_Agriculture:0 "Religious Agriculture"
 RAJ_Guru_Religious_Agriculture_desc:0 "Hinduism has always been the faith of the rural and agrarian people of India. It is one of the common folk, of traditions held for millennia. It is inevitable that Hinduism's teachings should be tied deeply with our agriculture. Our farmers and growers will use faith and spirit to bring forth better crops and build a stronger and more organized rural society."
 RAJ_Guru_Colonize_Towns:0 "Colonize the Towns"
 RAJ_Guru_Colonize_Towns_desc:0 "The civil war was devastating to us all, but the small towns of India felt it the hardest. Towns are now near-empty, their populations having all been killed or forced to flee in the chaos of war. Now, as we rebuild, we have to bring these towns back to their former ideal states. We will move those who fled to the cities back to their homes. We will give the city's lost and tired home and lands in the countryside. We will give them all opportunity in the towns, the true heart of India."
 RAJ_Guru_Mandatory_Loyalty:0 "Mandatory Loyalty"
 RAJ_Guru_Mandatory_Loyalty_desc:0 "How could we have not thought of it earlier? Simply require everyone to be loyal! That's the problem here, disloyalty, and the solution is so simple! Just mandate that all must follow our will, it's genius! Technically that's already the case, but this will surely help us greatly and solve many problems. Let's put it into law this very instant!"
 RAJ_Guru_Shot_in_Dark:0 "Shots in the Dark"
 RAJ_Guru_Shot_in_Dark_desc:0 "Traitors everywhere, traitors EVERYWHERE! They are in every office, every cabinet position! Why won't they just go away, go away, GO AWAY! I see them in every corner, they want to destroy us, to destroy ME! That general looked at me funny, he's obviously plotting a coup, get rid of him! That minister just stuttered a bit, he's clearly taking bribes, send him to a labor camp! When will there be no more traitors, when will I have finally cleansed India, when, when, when will it just END?"
 RAJ_Guru_Final_Act:0 "The Final Act"
 RAJ_Guru_Final_Act_desc:0 "For all we have done, it has been in vain. Every traitor removed, every rat exterminated, it just seems that a new one takes their place. No more. It is time to end this. We will bring salvation to India no matter the cost. We will do anything and everything it takes to get rid of all those who would stop the Mahaan Pundit, and we will save our nation. This is it. the Final Act."
 RAJ_Guru_National_Purge:0 "The National Purge"
 RAJ_Guru_National_Purge_desc:0 ""There is only one way forwards. It is a path of anguish, a path that all others would be too weak to follow. I alone can do what has to be done. We limited our search to those affiliated with our government, but that was clearly not enough. Every citizen of India must prove their loyalty to me. Every man should be willing to die for my nation. Every woman should be ready to toil in the fields until she collapses for India. Every child must shout my name and revere my cause. Those who deny me shall know only agony."\n- Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar in a private adress to Union Government ministers, [GetYear]"
 RAJ_Guru_Unity_Through_Strength:0 "Unity Through Strength"
 RAJ_Guru_Unity_Through_Strength_desc:0 "India is whole once again, for I have made it so. Every Indian knows his place, his purpose. We are brought together because all who would separate us will be annihilated. Any who would question the state is one who opposes me, and those who oppose me never see the light of day again. To be happy is to serve the nation, and to be unhappy is against the Mahaan Pundit's will and will be punished. Together, we move forwards as one."
 RAJ_Guru_Less_Purge:0 "The Purge Burns Out"
 RAJ_Guru_Less_Purge_desc:0 "Every day, fewer traitors are caught. Fewer are executed or erased or sent to the camps. Though it seemed impossible, the government is finally stabilizing, and servants of the state can now hold their positions for more than a week without revealing themselves as corrupt. It could be too good to be true, but maybe, just maybe, the Mahaan Pundit has finally cleansed the nation. Now, we can finally focus on other things and move forwards."
 RAJ_Guru_Unity_Through_Personality:0 "Unity Through Personality"
 RAJ_Guru_Unity_Through_Personality_desc:0 ""I have finally brought an end to the corruption that plagued us! Through my wise words and guidance, we managed to bring a new dawn to India. I alone had the strength necessary to save India, and I alone did what had to be done. All who would betray me and take down India from the inside have been swept away by my powerful hand. I alone have brought unity! All praise the new India! All praise the gods! All praise the Mahaan Pundit!"\n- Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar in a private address to RSS members, [GetYear]"
 RAJ_Guru_Cult_of_Personality:0 "Cult of Personality"
 RAJ_Guru_Cult_of_Personality_desc:0 "He is our bringer of salvation. He is the master of Hinduism and all who follow it. He is lord of body, mind, and soul. No other could have brought such glory, such brilliant beauty to our nation. He has proven himself as more than any man, truly divine in his ability. He is our leader, our lord, our saviour, our judge. He is our Guruji, and he alone is master of us all."

 RAJ_Indira_Victory:0 "The State's Defendants"
 RAJ_Indira_Victory_desc:0 "Indira has always acted in the best interests of the republic. Her aggressive attitude towards communists, Hindutva and other opponents were always out of a love of liberty and a hatred of despotism and foreign domination. While some have said that Indira should remain a dictator, she has decided to eventually step down and allow for elections to commence. Truly, she is a model for us all!"
 RAJ_Indira_Democracy:0 "Wartime Democracy"
 RAJ_Indira_Democracy_desc:0 "One of the arguments made by those would-be dictators is that wartime and other periods of crisis require a firm hand and total unity of the home front. While this is true, this doesn't have to necessarily come from a dictatorship. In fact, a democracy, with stable elections and a functioning party system, could be just as, if not more, effect. In essence, we can preserve our principles and still act decisively in great times of crisis. We have achieved the best of both worlds!"
 RAJ_Indira_Corporate_Advantage:0 "The Corporate Advantage"
 RAJ_Indira_Corporate_Advantage_desc:0 "The promotion of business has been a primary concern of our republic since the economic crisis started. Indian companies are making less profits, paying their workers less for longer hours, and some are even involved in illegal activity just to make ends meet. This mustn't continue; starting now, our government will provide economic incentives to start-ups and help get companies on hard times back on their feet. A strong nation requires strong business, so we should do whatever we can to make sure we get back on track."
 RAJ_Indira_Liberalize_Economy:0 "Liberalize the Economy"
 RAJ_Indira_Liberalize_Economy_desc:0 "In order to survive economically we are going to have to open our markets ad welcome foreign competition. This will allow us to receive the benefits of development from these new investors, and get on better terms with other nations, in particular, the United States. Some won't like this, and argue that this will open us to exploitation and economic imperialism, but even if that were true, we don't have much of a choice. Either we develop and rise, or don't and fall."
 RAJ_Indira_Social_Honesty:0 "Social Honesty"
 RAJ_Indira_Social_Honesty_desc:0 "All democratic forms of government require a citizenry who knows exactly what is happening within the government and, therefore, are willing to place their trust in it. Without that trust, the government cannot rightfully claim that they are acting within the people's interest; instead, they are acting within their own interest. In order to avoid that, bureaucratism and general vagueness will be replaced with transparency and honesty. This will not only give the people trust, it also saves us from having to deal with the often complicated affairs of keeping up lies."
 RAJ_Indira_Invest_Freedom:0 "Investments in Freedom"
 RAJ_Indira_Invest_Freedom_desc:0 "One of the points made by economists after the war was how many of the tools used by governments to keep the economy afloat during wartime could also be used during peacetime. For example, war bonds are an effective way of preventing hyperinflation while still putting money into the economy. For peacetime, then we can use "freedom investments" to keep inflation down while we stimulate the economy to help with economic growth. As much as we hate to admit, even war can create some positives."
 RAJ_Indira_Labour_Relations:0 "The Labour Relations Act"
 RAJ_Indira_Labour_Relations_desc:0 "The Indian National Congress, even with Indira, has always been rooted in the ideas of democratic socialism. We have sought to preserve the welfare and prosperity of our people, by using the state to restrict capitalism's worst effects while promoting its best. To further these goals, this act shall work to improve relations with the workers of this nation, by increasing union representation, lowering workweek hours and a general increase to the minimum wage. the people who built this country deserve better, after all."
 RAJ_Indira_War_Bonds:0 "Issue War Bonds"
 RAJ_Indira_War_Bonds_desc:0 "All war efforts require money; without it, all the talk of tactics and equipment and movement are meaningless. In order to ensure that our economy can properly sustain conflict, we will begin issuing war bonds. By adding additional money into circulation, the bonds can help remove money, and thus, control inflation. This means that we can worry less about the worth of money going down during wartime, and focus more on sustaining the war effort and defeating the usurpers."
 RAJ_Indira_Democratic_War:0 "The Democratic War Effort"
 RAJ_Indira_Democratic_War_desc:0 "Our young republic faces powerful enemies in the form of Japan and their stooge in Bengal, Bose. In order to ensure that we never are defeated by those ghouls, we must continue improving on our plans of military and economic mobilization. Countries like Russia during the Great War suffered tremendously for not being able to organize quickly and effectively against the invading enemy, and we know how that story ended. We shall not end the same way. Our nation must have a coherent and effective plan of organization and defense from day one, and this initiative will give us just that."

By providing money for those in dire situations, he was widely loved amongst the Dalit. However, it is still far behind what it needs to be; the amount of money provided is still too small for many, and many still demand the implementation of survivor's benefit, medical care and other services.

Our government shall work to protect these freedoms, by passing new laws protecting freedom of speech, the right of the press to publish dissenting ideas, and the freedom to worship whatever god or gods they may believe in. This plurality in belief shall create a more unified people, and a better public discourse."
 RAJ_Indira_Democratic_Ideals:0 "Promote Democratic Ideals"
 RAJ_Indira_Democratic_Ideals_desc:0 "As our government begins to stabilize once more, it is important to remind the public how lucky they are. Under a more despotic system, a crisis like that would have crippled all levels of the government, but thanks to a system of shared powers, and a caring leader like Indira, we were able to persevere and survive. Our government should begin distributing leaflets and buying ads thanking the people for remaining calm, and reminding them of their duty to preserve democracy at all costs."

Sadly, our republic hasn't improved on this; our officers still continue to act callously and instill distrust within the people. Not anymore; starting today, the police will be held on a much tighter leash, and will have to go through a lot more paperwork and planning before they bust down someone's door. We still need protectors against crime, of course, but they ought to act more calmly and level-headed."
