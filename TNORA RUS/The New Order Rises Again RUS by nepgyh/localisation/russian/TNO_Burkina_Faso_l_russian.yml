 POLITICS_MAURICE_YAMEOGO_DESC:0 "Чтобы понять, почему Морис Ямеого так предан идее Французской Африки до такой степени, что получил прозвище - "Monsieur Maurice", one has to know his past. Shunned and despised even by his own family simply for being interested in Christianity, Yaméogo left his old life to enter a seminary. But his relationships strayed far from the ecclesiastical standard. Yaméogo wanted to be a priest, but he was very keen on women and parties. In 1939, he left the seminary without graduating and was hired as a clerk by the French colonial administration. This extremely prestigious post meant success, security and prestige, and while the war raged in West Africa, Yaméogo was sent to Abidjan, a paradise for "evolved" Africans.\n\nThe rewards from Free France coupled with Yaméogo's ambition made him extremely loyal to the French cause in West Africa. When he returned to his homeland, he restored to popular acclaim the administration of Upper Volta, now called the republic of Mossiland, but refused to collaborate with other Africanist leaders like Senghor. Then Yaméogo eliminated all parliamentary opposition, purged all his enemies and imposed a one party system.\n\nYaméogo claims that Mossiland is a free, united and democratic republic, a shining example of African liberation, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Mossiland is a divided, weak and despotic statelet, completely dependent on French help to defend itself from more powerful warlords bordering the country. While the strategy works for now, if support from Free France comes to cease, Yaméogo will quickly find himself isolated, and while he often meets with De Gaulle to stay on good terms, at some point it will be one time too much."
