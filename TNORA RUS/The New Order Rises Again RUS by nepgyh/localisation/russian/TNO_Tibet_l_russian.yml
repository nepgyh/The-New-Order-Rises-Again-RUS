 TIB_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The isolated mountain kingdom of Tibet has, despite being internationally recognised by all but a few sympathetic states as part of China, found itself isolated from the affairs of the Co-Prosperity Sphere other than occasional diplomacy from both its allies and Japan, who, despite its lack of recognition for Tibet, maintains de facto relations with the nation. Tibet is very much stuck in the past, being a theocratic absolute monarchy led by the young Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso. However, with China just over the border, it surely cannot be long until Beijing retakes Lhasa."
