 BEN_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The Azad Hind is a nation born of unfortunate circumstances. Originally founded with the purpose of liberating India with the help of Japan, things quickly turned sour as Britain fell and could no longer exert its grip over the subcontinent. Rather than joining us as their one government, the people of India formed their own nation. Now, Indians were fighting their own brethren rather than the oppressors, and the war went from a hopeful revolution to a cruel conflict where brother took up arms against brother. Eventually a ceasefire was reached, and the two Indias retreated to establish themselves as nations. Bose, however, has not forgotten his dream of a free and united India, and, as darkness looms, he may soon get his chance."

 POLITICS_BOSE_DESC:0 "Subhas Chandra Bose, the President and Netaji of the Republic of India, has seen much in his life. Not only has he seen the failure of the Indian National Congress and the growth of the Free Indian Army, but he has lived to see the independence of India, the fall of the British Raj, and the dark chaos of the Second War of Independence.\n\nBose has always fought for freedom, and, despite the silent disappointment of the Japanese, he shall never bend to the rule or demand of any oppressor - not the Japanese, not the Europeans, not the Americans, and not the rotten ship of the INC. However, India cannot stand broken for much longer; with almost 20 years, how long can it be before India is once again in the chaos and terror of war, with brother against brother, in the field of battle? Nobody knows. Not Nehru, not Japan, not America, not even Bose.\n\nHowever, with his former comrades rebelling against him under the matter of change, the nationalists of all corners of Free India tearing at the seams, and the more radical sides of the spectrum beginning to rise up, Bose will have to steer the ship that he has steered for twenty years. Can he do it for twenty more?"
 POLITICS_MOHAN_SINGH_DESC:0 "После долгой и выдающейся карьеры на службе у Субхаса Чандры Боса генерал Мохан Сингх занимает пост временного президента Индии, дабы восстановить затухшее пламя субхасизма.\n\nВначале Сингх был капитаном индийской армии, направленной в Малайю. Когда японцы захватили эту британскую колонию, капитан Фудзивара Иваити подружился с Сингхом, и тот убедил японца создать особую армию для борьбы за независимость Индии из числа пленных индийцев. Изначально план оказался под угрозой, потому что штаб Императорской армии Японии отказался от этой идеи, а Фудзивара покинул Малайзию, пока не появился Субхас Чандра Бос, приведший Азад Хинд к победе.\n\nПосле войны радость Мохана Сингха от освобождения Индии постепенно сменилась разочарованием. Время шло, Бос постарел, а Сингха отодвинули на второй план, где он и начал высказывать недовольство правительством. Но как только вечный глава Азад Хинда умер, и власть перешла к небольшой бенгальской клике Чаттерджи, страна погрузилась в хаос. Именно тогда Сингх решил взять ситуацию под контроль, чтобы стабилизировать индийское правительство и положить конец беспорядку, оставленному недостойными преемниками Боса.\n\nС восстановлением порядка Мохан Сингх хочет, чтобы все знали одно: он предан наследию Боса. Безоговорочно и полностью. И под его руководством восстановление стабильного управления завершится созданием полноценного гражданского правительства."
 POLITICS_LAKSHMI_SAHGAL_DESC:0 "Невероятно уважаемая личность, даже на республиканском западе, Лакшми Сагхал всё же каким-то чудом смогла стать президентом страны. Но, возможно, её победа, именно то, в чём нуждаются трудолюбивые женщины и добросовестные работники Индии.\n\nСахгал была борцом за независимость Индии, когда её фамилия звучала как Сваминатхан. Специально прибыв в Малайзию после неудачного замужества, она вступила в Индийскую национальную армию и сражалась на передовой против британцев, командуя легендарным "женским полком". Выйдя на пенсию в звании бригадира, став первой женщиной добившейся такого высокого звания, вскоре Лакшми стала политиком, продолжая учиться на акушера-гинеколога. Именно в это время Сахгал убедилась, что социализм - это верный путь для её государства.\n\nВозможно, именно военная служба Сахгал и связи, которые она приобрела, сделали её подходящим кандидатом на пост президента. Помимо своего мужа, генерала Према Кумара Сахгала, она также поддерживала хорошие отношения с лидерами Всеиндийского блока, созданного ещё до Второй мировой войны. Именно такие люди, как Сардул Сингх Кавешир и Шил Бхадра Яджи, оказали ей поддержку в 40-х и 50-х годах, а затем помогли подняться и на пост президента.\n\nТеперь, находясь на такой высокой должносьт, Сахгал ставит перед собой амбициозные цели. Она хочет, чтобы широкомасштабные изменения в законодательстве и политике способствовали созданию более справедливых условий. Помимо этого правительство "новых левых" будет активно укреплять позиции рабочих и фермеров Индии, от которых так сильно зависит процветание государства."
 POLITICS_MAHENDRA_PRATAP_DESC:0 "Махендра Пратап, рожденный в княжеской семье, не ожидал, что станет тем, кем он стал. Он путешествовал, добираясь до Южной Африки, чтобы работать вместе с Махатмой в надежде привлечь внимание общественности к жестокости британцев в Индии. В 1914 году представился шанс заручиться подлинной внешней поддержкой независимости Индии в виде войны, настолько великой и ужасной, что ее стали называть войной, положившей конец всем войнам - Первой мировой войной. Затем Пратап отправился на встречу с самим кайзером (вместе с Владимиром Лениным), который наградил его медалью. После этого Пратап отправился в Кабул, где создал временное правительство в изгнании свободной Индии со своим президентом.\n\nНесмотря на первые успехи и внутреннюю и международную поддержку, правительство пало в 1919 году, после того как британцы потребовали, чтобы афганский эмир выдворил их из страны. Но Пратап еще не закончил. К этому времени за его голову была назначена награда, поскольку он представлял серьезную угрозу для британцев, что заставило его бежать в Японию. Во время пребывания в Токио он тесно сотрудничал с Субхасом Чандрой Босом, считая его Азад Хинд естественным преемником своего собственного правительства, созданного в 1915 году. Однако только после окончания Войны за независимость в 1953 году Пратап смог вернуться домой. Его опыт и впечатляющий послужной список борца за свободу, естественно, привели его в Азад Хинд, и он быстро оказался на стороне Боса. Для многих теперь уже пожилой бывший принц является его естественным преемником. Действительно, даже японцы были бы довольны его приходом к власти. Время, проведенное Пратапом в Японии, познакомило его с идеями паназиатства, которых он теперь твердо придерживается. Именно эта смесь внешней и внутренней поддержки, а также его популистские взгляды принесли ему популярность, а теперь и победу. Человек из народа, Пратап может надеяться на его поддержку, когда он начинает свое правление в качестве Нетаджи. К сожалению для него, ничто не может быть столь определенным - по крайней мере, в Азад Хинд."
 POLITICS_CHANDI_PRASAD_BHATT_DESC:0 "Родившись в деревне Уттаракханди, Чанди Прасад Бхатт быстро понял проблемы горных сельских общин, нехватку сельскохозяйственных угодий и работы. Как и многие гандисты, Бхатт перебрался в Азад Хинд, где снова поселился на склонах Гималаев. Прошли годы, пока Свободная Индия осваивала свои земли для предстоящей битвы с Республикой. Многие леса были вырублены, дороги построены на некогда плодородных полях, и даже некоторые древние деревни были разрушены ради военных действий. Бхатт, все больше и больше обеспокоенный разрушением природы и сельской жизни, решил взять дело в свои руки. Он создал кооперативы, чтобы помочь местным рабочим конкурировать с квалифицированными рабочими из городов, получая ценные контракты на работу. Позднее усилия по спасению самой природы стали включать коллективную закупку деревьев, которые были так необходимы для дров и строительных материалов. На протяжении всех своих кампаний против урбанизации Бхатт демонстрировал огромную решимость, но никогда не прибегал к насилию.\n\nКогда в Азад Хинд наконец-то прошли свободные и честные выборы, Бхатт создал Свободную индийскую партию зеленых, призванную защищать не только сельские общины, но и саму природу. Самым радикальным из всего этого был пацифистский подход партии к политике. Поэтому для многих наблюдателей стало неожиданностью, когда такой молодой человек стал лидером "Азад Хинд." Они также были шокированы, когда услышали его основную политику, в центре которой были экология и пацифизм. Тем не менее, Чанди Прасад Бхатт - это действительно новый Нетаджи, и у него, безусловно, много новых идей для Индии."
 POLITICS_PV_NARASIMHA_RAO_DESC:0 "Памулапарти Венката Нарасимха Рао родился не в высшей касте и не в высшем сословии. Он не родился в семье борцов за свободу и политиков. Скорее, он был сыном бедной семьи, говорящей на языке телугу, в одной из деревень Хайдарабада. Однако Рао преодолел свою бедность и получил не только начальное образование, но и степень бакалавра искусств в Университете Османии. Оттуда он присоединился к движению за независимость Индии, участвуя в движении Свадеши и вступая в Индийский национальный конгресс. Однако все это было прервано, когда Вторая война за независимость перетекла из войны освободительной в войну гражданскую.\n\nВ хаосе войны Рао разрывался между тем, поддержать ли популярное, но поддерживаемое Японией правительство Азад Хинд или независимую, но предположительно пробританскую Индийскую Республику. В конце концов, после долгих раздумий, он неохотно присоединился к Азад Хинд, вступив во Всеиндийский передовой блок, чтобы закрепить свое место в системе. После войны Рао медленно продвигался по служебной лестнице, став председателем ссыльного конгресса провинции Мадрас. Когда на сцену вышли сахгалы, он предложил стать министром внутренних дел, и его предложение было с радостью принято.\n\nРао позже бросил свою собственную шляпу на ринг и стал следующим Нетаджи и президентом правительства Азад Хинд. Пообещав экономическую либерализацию и отмену законов о государственном атеизме, народ доказал свою мудрость и впустил его. Однако не все эшелоны правительства и военные рады принять его, и ему придется действовать очень мудро, чтобы люди, которые привели его к власти, не обратились против него..."
 POLITICS_BAL_THACKERAY_DESC:0 "Бал Кешав Тэкерей родился в 1926 году в семье высшего класса маратхи, и с раннего детства у него были большие мечты. Мечты о величии, лидерстве и государстве индусов и только индусов. Однако эти мечты были разрушены во время Второй войны за независимость Индии, когда нехватка продовольствия и ограничения, введенные временным правительством, заставили юного Тэкерея совершить тяжелый поход через всю Индию, покинув Махараштру и землю Шиваджи. Несмотря на эти радикальные перемены, Теккерей никогда не отказывался от отличительных черт своей идеологии - Хиндутвы, Аканд Бхарат и чистого, без примесей, неприятия всего иностранного. В частности, Тхакерей с крайним презрением относится к исламу - развращающему, чуждому течению мысли, которое проникло в Бхарат в результате вторжений и завоеваний.\n\nТхакерей первоначально нашел своих союзников в небольшой общине эмигрантов из Маратхи, многие из которых разделяли его идеалы. Примерно в это время был создан Шив Фаудж - военизированное формирование, полностью лояльное к Теккерею и его близким сторонникам. Но к 1950-м годам он пришел к пониманию того, что в такой чужой стране, как Азад Хинд, его маратхский шовинизм оттолкнет от него подавляющее большинство населения. Затем Шив Фаудж отошел от такого превосходства и перешел к более широкой идеологии, основанной на Хиндутве, что в конечном итоге привело к напряженному, но необходимому союзу с Сангх Париваром - созданным Бхаратия Джана Сангх и Раштрия Сваямсевак Сангх на основе ненависти к другим основным политическим фракциям в стране. Будучи выдающимся деятелем Паривара, ни одна фракция не ожидала, что Теккерей сможет даже бросить вызов статус-кво в организации, а тем более взять власть. Но, вопреки всему, он сделал именно это.\n\nСейчас Бал Теккерей занимает верховное положение в Калькутте, его Шив Фаудж предан и верен, и мало что мешает ему начать праведный, священный крестовый поход, чтобы воссоединить великую империю, которой когда-то была Индия. В процессе Шив Фаудж будет стремиться к Свачх Бхарат - единой святой, чистой Индии, свободной от развращающего влияния Запада. Пока армии Шивы маршируют вперед к новому рассвету, мир застыл в ожидании следующего шага Бала Теккерея."
 POLITICS_JB_KRIPALANI_DESC:0 "Jivatram Bhagwandas Kripalani has seen much in his great, long life. For five decades, he has been deeply involved with Indian politics, from colonial rule to independence and the years after. In his early years, Kripalani joined up with the growing independence movement following the return of the Mahatma from South Africa. During the early 1920s, Kriplani worked as a lecturer of history and English while serving as part of the non-cooperation movement. He would become a close adherent of the Mahatma, and was given the task of spreading his teachings to other parts of India. Later on, he would be on several occasions arrested for more direct actions against colonial rule, including organising protests and for distributing anti-British material. Kripalani would be invloved in the top affairs of Congress througout the late 1920s and into the next decade. By this point, Kripalani had also turned to be a firm adherent of Gandhian ideals, particularly those relating to socialism.\n\nWhile independence did finally come to India, the nation was quickly split in two by war between the Nehru's capitalistic Republic and Bose's truly equal and socialist Free India. Gandhi and many of his followers defected to the latter, with Kriplani being one of them. In East India, Kriplani would go on to eventually found a new party together with figures like Lakshmi Saghal, the Revolutionary Socialist Party.\n\nKriplani, saw the way to victory in the elections through cooperation with the Naxalite communist rebels, led by Charu Majumdar. This coalition would indeed prove to be successful in the elections. Kripalani is now leader of the Azad Hind, committed to the principles of Gandhian Socialism, light agrarianism and resistance against Japan. Yet there is much work for him to do to secure his position - winning an election means when there is always someone to take your place by any means necessary."

 BEN_Persistent_Communal_Violence:0 "Persecution of Abrahamic Faiths"
 BEN_Persistent_Communal_Violence_desc:0 "Even before the Muslim Revolt, the Azad Hind has fanatically pursued a policy of persecution against certain religions, especially Christianity and Islam, in order to purge supposed pro-Western and terrorist elements from India. This policy has manifested itself in multiple examples of government-sanctioned violence and persecution of Indian Christians and Muslims, who are often taken away from their homes and sent to concentration camps, forced to work in the government's heavy industry until they die. However, while many both at home and abroad know of the persecution of Muslims, the persecution of Christians is far more secretive, with most Naga and Mizo Christians being sent to secluded valley camps, where they work for the extraction of iron and coal. Living conditions are poor, and deaths from malnutrition, disease, and general lack of proper working conditions are all too common."
 BEN_Private_Military_Contractors:0 "Private Military Contractors"
 BEN_Private_Military_Contractors_desc:0 "While the Indian National Army is the largest in the world in terms of manpower, it isn't the only part of Free India's military; private military contractors, known more popularly by the more archaic name of mercenaries, make up a substantial portion of the military. While other parts of the world (and, closer to Calcutta, the INA) have criticised our large amount of PMCs as "a violation of the Geneva Conventions" and "illegal", we have evidence to prove that these matters are perfectly legal. If they weren't, why would the Deputy Netaji be a PMC?"
 BEN_Martial_Law:0 "The Military Administration of East Bengal"
 BEN_Martial_Law_desc:0 "The Military Administration of East Bengal was established in the aftermath of the Muslim Revolt in order to prevent the growth of Islamism, as well as, to a lesser extent, Islam as a whole. Established at the request of military maverick Mohan Singh in 1955, it quickly went from a temporary military authority until stability could be reestablished to an indefinite occupation - and a hell on Earth for the Muslims. Bengalis, Assamese, Naga, and Bodo are routinely shot on sight for suspicion of terrorism or, even worse, kidnapped by security officers and sent to slave labour camps where they go with little food and work until they die. Public outcry has emerged against the MAEC both domestically and internationally, with calls for an end to the military occupation and arrest of Singh, not to mention the likelihood of another revolt if we maintain the MAEC. We must find a solution to benefit both sides, and quickly!"

Making up the former East Bengal Region, the large area is governed as a representative democracy with its own elections and laws, much like the provinces of India. However, unlike the other provinces, the Autonomous Region of East Bengal is able to do things that would be considered out of the question typically, such as allowance of liquor. Every year, the Chairman of East Bengal reports directly to the Congress KaWazraa to discuss occurances in the region, as well as, of course, their requests for what to be allowed in terms of leeway. This seems to be the best way to make most people happy. However, supporters of Hindutva decry this as giving radical Islam too much of a voice, and many worry that the autonomous region stretching over not just Muslim-majority regions, but also Hindu and Christian ones has a high probability of causing conflict in the future."

Every year, the Ameer of the Islam Autonomous Region (who is also leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami) reports directly to the Congress KaWazraa to discuss occurances in the region, as well as, of course, their requests for what to be allowed in terms of leeway. This seems to be the best way to make the Islamists happy. However, many decry this as handing over power to Islamic terrorists, and giving it a voice in the government.

This, in turn, causes a famine, causing immense loss of human life, until the rats are hunted and taken out. Then, 50 years later, this phenomenon - known to the population as "Mautam", or "bamboo death" - begins anew. This year, 1962, is predicted to be the worst Mautam in history. Amidst a backdrop of increasing sectarian tension, we must act, and do so with great caution - it could mean the future, or the death, of our state."

Since the death of his predecessor, Comrade Kiani, he has served as the Indian National Army's Chief of Staff, as well as Military Administrator of East Bengal. Singh has proposed that we do not bother on extensive aid to the Northeasterners, with the justification that most of it will be captured by terrorists. Instead, he supports a small amount of humanitarian aid; if nature is to take them out, then it is no matter - Singh has been pursuing a rigorous policy of state atheism in East Bengal, anyways, and Mother Nature just happens to agree with him."

 BEN_Lib2_The_Moderate_Triumph_desc:0 "Winning a staggering victory at the elections, the Azad Tabaar Majlis has finally managed to place Pamulaparthi Venkata Narasimha Rao in the position of Netaji of the Free Indian Government. Now, the newly sworn-in Netaji must cement his hold over the Azad Hind - for the battle to truly win the hearts of the Indian people has only just began. Sweeping plans of economic and social reforms, envisioned by Rao to bring true change about in India, shall be immediately put in place by the new government - starting with a new, freer approach to economy, and a loosening of repressive and discriminatory social laws."
 BEN_Lib2_Emancipating_the_People:0 "Emancipating the People"
 BEN_Lib2_Emancipating_the_People_desc:0 "For centuries, India has been a land of many peoples, ethnicities, languages and religions, all living together in harmony - Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists and Christians were all equal and free in India's bosom. And yet, in the pursuit of aggressive and chauvinistic endeavors, fueled by nationalism and etatism, the Azad Hind Government has enacted policies that discriminate against the many minorities of India. By lifting these unjust and unfair laws, we can move Azad Hind towards being a truly progressive and free society."
 BEN_Lib2_Meet_With_Activists:0 "Meet With Activists"
 BEN_Lib2_Meet_With_Activists_desc:0 "Currently, there are several grassroots movements, either barely legal or outright illegal, campaigning against our government for the rights of the minorities of the Azad Hind, such as the Muslims and the Bengalis. The most important of these movements are known as the Awami League, claiming to represent the Bengali community of the Azad Hind, which sees itself threatened by the pan-Indian nationalism propagated by our government - and the Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamist organization claiming to fight for the rights of Muslims in our country alongside its closely-related military arm, the Fauj-e-Islami Bangal. The organizations' leaders, respectively Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Ziaur Rahman, have always been public enemies number one and two to us. By entering sincere dialogue with the Awami League and the Jamaat-e-Islami, we will be able to begin the process of mending the divide between our government and the Bengalis, hopefully putting an end to the sectarian divide in our country."
 BEN_Lib2_Reopen_the_Bars:0 "Reopen the Bars"
 BEN_Lib2_Reopen_the_Bars_desc:0 "Prohibition has always been enshrined in the constitution of the Azad Hind - not as a religious dogma, but as a necessity to maintain a strong and moral state, safe from Western corruption and immorality. However, this only had the result of creating a flourishing market for alcohol and moonshine, which is even more dangerous than normal alcohol consumption and has severe effects on our economy. We shall lift the harmful prohibition laws, allowing anyone who has a license to sell alcohol, and everyone of an adult age shall be allowed to consume it if they wish."
 BEN_Lib2_Protect_Muslim_Jobs:0 "Protect Muslim Jobs"
 BEN_Lib2_Protect_Muslim_Jobs_desc:0 "The numerous Muslims living in the Azad Hind have often been oppressed and discriminated against by the state, as Islam was viewed as a harmful influence on a country attempting to build a strong sense of secular nationalism. For this reason, the Muslim communities in our state are often poor, downtrodden, and most of all constantly in danger of being radicalized by Islamist preachers and rabble rousers. We shall enact laws to safeguard Muslim jobs and communities against systemic discrimination, and hopefully this will let the Islamic people of the Azad Hind know that Netaji Rao intends to work for them too."
 BEN_Lib2_Repeal_the_Atheism_Laws:0 "Repeal the Atheism Laws"
 BEN_Lib2_Repeal_the_Atheism_Laws_desc:0 "On paper, our country is officially an atheist one - as religions are a harmful and backwards influence on the new, rising Indian state. In practice, the state atheism laws implemented in our country are often simply used as a tool to target and discriminate Muslims and Christians in our country, while Hindu sects and organizations are essentially allowed to operate freely. By finally lifting these useless and de facto discriminatory laws, and allowing anyone to worship whatever they please in whatever way they like, we will make an essential step towards ensuring peace among the numerous ethnic and religious communities in our country."
 BEN_Lib2_Affirmative_Action:0 "Affirmative Action"
 BEN_Lib2_Affirmative_Action_desc:0 "The stain of discrimination and stigma is a persistent one - even after discriminatory laws have been lifted on paper, downtrodden communities will still find it hard to actually progress in society, as the mentality of the masses is still anchored to the old ways of discrimination. We shall enact policies to support integration of Muslim and Bengali communities in the Azad Hind, attempting to bridge inequalities in wages, encouraging access to the education system, promoting diversity in workplaces, and issuing reparations and apologies for past wrongs."
 BEN_Lib2_Divide_the_Cities:0 "Divide the Cities"
 BEN_Lib2_Divide_the_Cities_desc:0 "While rampant sectarianism is a major problem in many cities of the Azad Hind, with Hindu and Muslim communities often clashing in the streets, there are few ways to solve the problem once and for all. Instead, we can opt for a more short-term solution that will hopefully at least contain the problem and make it more manageable. By dividing up our cities in clearly defined districts, based on the population living there, we will be able to more easily police and patrol the areas in which conflict is likely to erupt, and thus put a quick end to the fighting. It's not a perfect solution by far, but it's the best one we've got."
 BEN_Lib2_United_Against_the_West:0 "United Against the West"
 BEN_Lib2_United_Against_the_West_desc:0 "In the borderlands and outskirts of our country, numerous guerrilla groups, paramilitary organizations, militias and insurgencies operate against us more or less openly. Often, these groups are simply regionalists who are worried about their autonomy and local rights being squashed by the overreach of the central government - one of the most prominent examples being the Bodoland Liberation Army, operating in the north of the country. We should attempt to make peace with some of these guerrillas, by reassuring them that we don't intend to infringe on their land's local autonomy, and by reminding them of the importance of our righteous struggle against the illegitimate regime of the so-called Republic of India and the ever-present threat of western imperialism."
 BEN_Lib2_An_End_to_Muslim_Oppression:0 "An End to Muslim Oppression"
 BEN_Lib2_An_End_to_Muslim_Oppression_desc:0 "As we have enacted laws to lift the oppression that plagued our Muslim communities, the time has come for the government to fully and firmly take a stand for the Islamic people of the Azad Hind. The last discriminatory and restrictive laws will be lifted, and we will send a powerful message of true unity and equality to the Sphere and to the world - the Azad Hind is a land where all Indians, regardless of religion or ethnicity, can feel safe at home. Most of all, this will go to great lengths to make the Netaji popular among the numerous Muslims of the country."
 BEN_Lib2_A_Freer_Market:0 "A Freer Market"
 BEN_Lib2_A_Freer_Market_desc:0 "Since its foundation, the Azad Hind has always enacted economic policies characterized by heavy state interventionism. In the long run, such attempts to control the market were clearly failures, as the economy of the Azad Hind struggled to develop and in fact lagged behind. One of the major goals of the Rao administration is to free up the markets of the Azad Hind, to let them control themselves and bring prosperity to the people of India. While this dramatic shift in policy might cause somewhat of a shock at first, it is the only way forward for the Azad Hind."
 BEN_Lib2_Encourage_Free_Trade_Practices:0 "Encourage Free Trade Practices"
 BEN_Lib2_Encourage_Free_Trade_Practices_desc:0 "The Azad Hind produces several goods which are coveted by the rest of the Sphere, and the world - likewise, the country also needs to import large amounts of resources and manufactured goods which are necessary to sustain its economy. However, the import and export of commodities has always been slowed down and hampered by protectionist policies, bureaucratic mismanagement, and other such barriers to international trade. By tearing down some of these barriers, we can encourage greater economic freedom and a better flow of trade between our country and the rest of the world."
 BEN_Lib2_Curb_Socialist_Practices:0 "Curb Socialist Practices"
 BEN_Lib2_Curb_Socialist_Practices_desc:0 "The long established praxis of the Azad Hind Government in matters of economics has always been one built around socialist ideas and methods - land collectivization, nationalization of industry, far-reaching economic plans, an extensive welfare state, and so forth. This has resulted in the economy of our country struggling to advance and failing to reach its full potential. By ending the socialist tendencies of our economic policy once and for all, we will wipe the slate clean and allow the introduction of new and far reaching reforms that will bring the economy of India into a new era."
 BEN_Lib2_Corporate_Welfare_Policy:0 "Corporate Welfare Policy"
 BEN_Lib2_Corporate_Welfare_Policy_desc:0 "To foster the economic growth of India, it is necessary to foster the growth of its corporations. Privately owned industrial conglomerates and businesses in the Azad Hind have always struggled to survive, because of strong competition coming from the state itself and the heavy protectionist barriers that strangled commerce. To kickstart the new Indian economy, we must ensure that corporations have what they need to stay afloat, and redirect some of our public spending into money grants, tax breaks, and other policies that will help Indian businesses flourish. It will be costly at first, but it will pay back in full in the long run."
 BEN_Lib2_Attract_Foreign_Companies:0 "Attract Foreign Companies"
 BEN_Lib2_Attract_Foreign_Companies_desc:0 "The Azad Hind cannot survive alone, and the ideals of autarky, which sound so good on paper, have always resulted in economic disasters whenever applied. The only way to make the country grow is to attract foreign capital to invest in the country, offering them favourable conditions to set up shop in India. This will not only bring more jobs and more prosperity to the country, increasing wages and consumption, but foreign money and technical know how will also be of great help in developing infrastructure in the country. Soon, all the capitalists in the Sphere and the neutral world will look at the Azad Hind as the best place to invest in all of Asia!"
 BEN_Lib2_Privatise_State_Corporations:0 "Privatize State Corporations"
 BEN_Lib2_Privatise_State_Corporations_desc:0 "Historically, the economy of the Azad Hind has always relied on large, government-owned corporations and conglomerates for much of its heavy lifting - large industrial and resource extraction companies, giving jobs to much of the country's population, have always been owned and managed by the state. And yet, this caused numerous problems, from the businesses failing to prosper due to getting stuck in bureaucratic mires, to poorly made plans which completely crippled production and commerce. By selling off state owned corporations and assets to private capitalists, we'll make sure they're in better hands - managed by actual businessmen rather than party bureaucrats, and that the new profits made by them will trickle down to the entirety of the Azad Hind. Not to mention, a boost of liquid money is always useful when in the middle of sweeping economic reform."
 BEN_Lib2_Support_Small_Business:0 "Support Small Business"
 BEN_Lib2_Support_Small_Business_desc:0 "It would be a mistake to assume that the health of an economy is measured by its biggest businesses and conglomerates. The true sign of a prospering economy is the flourishing of small and medium businesses, which are able to compete on an equal standing and thus are able to deliver the best goods and services to their consumers for a price decided by the free market. Thus, the best way to ensure our economy does well is to support these small businesses with further tax breaks and welfare for upstart entrepreneurs and businessmen, and laws to protect these small businesses against the competition of larger financial groups."
 BEN_Lib2_Support_Big_Business:0 "Support Big Business"
 BEN_Lib2_Support_Big_Business_desc:0 "Corporations and conglomerates are a necessity in any developed economy, and the Azad Hind is no exception. However, in the past, the heavily protectionist and etatist policies of our country discouraged big economic corporations from investing into the economy of the Azad Hind, which was often directly state managed. Now, we must ensure that this new wave of Indian capitalism continues to bear fruit by supporting the large industrial groups operating in the country, ensuring financial stability and passing legislation favourable to big businesses to make sure that they can continue to develop the Azad Hind's economy."
 BEN_Lib2_Kolkata_Stock_Exchange:0 "The New Kolkata Stock Exchange"
 BEN_Lib2_Kolkata_Stock_Exchange_desc:0 "In the past, our government neglected the field of finance in favour of a much more interventionist and direct economic planning - for this reason, the stock exchange located in Kolkata, established in 1908 and one of the oldest in the entirety of Asia, was closed down by the Free Indian authorities. Now, as our economy is on its way to truly become free, the time has come for a grand reopening of the Kolkata Stock Exchange - a new beacon of Asian capitalism, where corporations will be able to freely trade and invest. This will send a powerful message to the entirety of the world - that India is once again open for business."
 BEN_Lib2_Taking_Off_the_Gloves:0 "Taking Off the Gloves"
 BEN_Lib2_Taking_Off_the_Gloves_desc:0 "While our first round of social and economic reforms has been greatly successful in ameliorating some of the numerous problems which plague our country, the road ahead is still long, and there is still much left to do. The liberalization of our economy is to be continued if it truly is to bear fruit - likewise, the social reforms to end discrimination and state overreach in Indian society haven't yet destroyed the remaining issues which plague the Azad Hind. It is time for Netaji Rao to push back against opposition once and for all, and finally impose his vision of a truly free India on the country."
 BEN_Lib2_Life_and_Taxes:0 "Life and Taxes"
 BEN_Lib2_Life_and_Taxes_desc:0 "Two words are enough to put terror and fear into any bureaucrat and politician - tax reform. While cutting taxes is always an exceedingly popular move among the people, many in the government are terrified by the prospect that by lowering the influx of money coming into the coffers of the state, their institutions will be the first on the chopping block to get its funds revoked or diminished. No matter how much pushback from the government Netaji Rao will get, it is vital that the taxation system of the Azad Hind is reworked if we want to see the economy truly prosper."
 BEN_Lib2_The_Military_Budget:0 "The Military Budget"
 BEN_Lib2_The_Military_Budget_desc:0 "Due to paranoia over imperialist aggression from Western powers, the ever-present threat of the Republic of India just on our borders, and the necessity to maintain our autonomy and independence within the Sphere, the Azad Hind has always spent a lot of money on military matters, to maintain a large, strong and modern army. Our army is in fact the largest in the world by numbers - and it is also one of the most useless. Inefficiency, bloated budgets and politicized military command has resulted in disastrous sinkhole in our finances, in which money is poured into the military to simply disappear among the cliques. The best way to quickly plug this hole is to slash the military budget once and for all, cutting on useless, outdated, and inefficient military expenses once and for all."
 BEN_Lib2_Government_Services:0 "Government Services"
 BEN_Lib2_Government_Services_desc:0 "To say that our government is often overreaching would be an understatement - infrastructure projects, local bureaucracies, and industrial endeavours sponsored by the state are often a massive drag on our finances. We shall initiate a review of the services offered by our government, to see which ones are inefficient, unnecessary, or overfunded, in order to improve the inefficient ones, remove the unnecessary ones, and slash the budget of the overfunded ones. It won't be a popular move in our government, but every rupee we save by doing this is one rupee we don't need to extract from our citizens through taxes."
 BEN_Lib2_The_PMC_Problem:0 "The PMC Problem"
 BEN_Lib2_The_PMC_Problem_desc:0 "Ironically, the only sector which is usually best left in the hands of the state is largely privatized in the Azad Hind. Ever since the Great Muslim Revolt, in which the armies of Free India clashed against the Fauj-e-Islami and their western puppetmasters, numerous private military contractors, or PMCs, have been employed by the Indian National Army to provide training, combat assistance, and logistical service to our main army. While this has proved useful so far, relying on PMCs isn't exactly good for our reputation, and there are many who suggest that they should be eliminated."
 BEN_Lib2_The_New_Mosques:0 "The New Mosques"
 BEN_Lib2_The_New_Mosques_desc:0 "The repealing of state atheism laws has brought about a veritable blossoming of new mosques and Muslim religious institutions of all across the countries - once forced to operate clandestinely, now finally coming forward into the light and officially registering. These mosques are often not simply places of faith, but the centre of entire communities - providing social spaces to the people, charity to the poor, education to the youth, and so forth. Many people in the government argue that as they're not merely religious in nature, they should be taxed like all other enterprises, providing the state with a steady source of income. However, this move would surely risk alienating the Muslims of the Azad Hind just after we might have finally managed to win their hearts."
 BEN_Lib2_The_Private_Sector:0 "The Private Sector"
 BEN_Lib2_The_Private_Sector_desc:0 "As it is par for the course in many state-controlled economies, the private sector has never been allowed to flourish in the Azad Hind - always impeded by restrictive legislation, heavy taxation, and government competition. By further cutting taxes on the private sector, we can allow it to prosper and provide services to our citizens in a much more efficient way than the government used to, and much more cheaply for us. The new age of Indian capitalism has only just begun, and very soon we will be able to reap its fruits."
 BEN_Lib2_Cutting_Red_Tape:0 "Cutting Red Tape?"
 BEN_Lib2_Cutting_Red_Tape_desc:0 "Starting a business or investing into the Azad Hind has always been exceedingly difficult - as bureaucracy and heavy handed government control made it way too difficult for upstart entrepreneurs and foreign capitalists to actually profit from their investments in the short term. By slashing our bureaucratic barriers and actually making it easy and simple to set up shop in the Azad Hind, we will further encourage a new middle class of entrepreneurs to invest into the economy, causing more money and commodities to circulate and further fueling our rapid economic growth."
 BEN_Lib2_Allow_Military_Companies:0 "Allow Military Companies?"
 BEN_Lib2_Allow_Military_Companies_desc:0 "Since the very start of the Azad Hind's history, all military production and logistics has been strictly managed by the state-run Free Indian Arms, which supplied weapons, ammunition, vehicles and other equipment for our brave soldiers. However, this has caused the usual problems which state-run industry usually causes - inefficiency, poor logistics, and terrible bureaucracy. By allowing military companies to operate in the country, we will improve the efficiency of our military production and further encourage innovation in military technology. Surely it will prove unpopular in the government, as it will look like we are offloading the sacred duty of defending our nation to greedy capitalists, but this is merely another sector which we can make more efficient by introducing free market reforms."
 BEN_Lib2_Crunching_the_Numbers:0 "Crunching the Numbers"
 BEN_Lib2_Crunching_the_Numbers_desc:0 "Gross domestic product, gross national income, wages, projected growth, ease of doing business, wealth per adult. There are many indicators and indexes designed to measure how well a country is doing from a financial and economic standpoint, and the Azad Hind used to consistently rank poorly in all of them. However, now times have changed - our economy is booming, our country is modernizing, and our capitalists have never been happier. Time has come to put our economists hard at work into creating growth models and projections for the future, in order to further plan our economic expansion and reform for the years ahead."
 BEN_Lib2_The_Spectre_of_Socialism:0 "The Spectre of Socialism"
 BEN_Lib2_The_Spectre_of_Socialism_desc:0 "While we have begun to reinstate a capitalist policy in India, the spectre of socialism hasn't been banished yet. The many people who benefitted from state overreach and socialist policies of the old government have been angered by Netaji Rao's reforms, and the various socialist parties and politicians opposed to Rao are steadily growing more popular as a result. In order to safeguard against opposition, we must pass enforce new legislation to make sure that the system envisioned isn't torn down by some unpredictable political twist."
 BEN_Lib2_The_Matter_of_Healthcare:0 "The Matter of Healthcare"
 BEN_Lib2_The_Matter_of_Healthcare_desc:0 "The Azad Hind has always had a state-run healthcare system, providing everyone, no matter how rich or poor, with free treatment for any disease or accident. While great on paper, such a system quickly showed its weaknesses once applied in reality. Sometimes, bad management causes systemic inefficiency, and waiting lists are so long that people die while they're still waiting to be treated; other times, shortages of medical supplies or personnel prove disastrous for entire hospitals, resulting in villages or towns being deprived of vital access to healthcare. By introducing reforms in the system, cutting down on bureaucracy and allowing for more independent hospitals and health institutions, we can make sure that everyone still gets access to healthcare without all the hassles that come with our current, outdated and inefficient system."
 BEN_Lib2_Provincial_Rights_to_Prohibition:0 "Provincial Rights to Prohibition?"
 BEN_Lib2_Provincial_Rights_to_Prohibition_desc:0 "While our decision to lift prohibition laws has proven popular with the secular, liberal-minded and urban strata of our society, there have been numerous voices raised in protest. Especially in rural or Muslim-majority districts, many complain about the vices and immorality that this opening to alcohol will cause, and numerous local protests have been staged in favor of keeping prohibition laws. By allowing regions, districts and provinces in the country to decide for themselves whether to keep prohibition or not, we will make sure that everyone in the country gets to decide on this issue as they please - after all, it makes no difference for the government at large, and it will prove popular with many strata of the population who feel that the government does not care enough for them."
 BEN_Lib2_Private_Hospitals:0 "The Private Hospitals"
 BEN_Lib2_Private_Hospitals_desc:0 "Around the world, numerous countries have allowed private hospitals to operate. While this may seem strange or outright unethical at first, upon second thought it is in fact a very sound move - when a hospital is privatized, it is operated as a business, and like all businesses, it has to be efficient and provide good service if it wants to stay afloat in the midst of competition. By allowing private hospitals to operate in our country, we will further improve the efficiency of our healthcare system and allow anyone to choose to be treated in privatized health institutions, if they so wish."
 BEN_Lib2_Socialism_in_the_Government:0 "Socialism in the Government?"
 BEN_Lib2_Socialism_in_the_Government_desc:0 "Despite the success of Rao's reforms, there are still rumors circulating about widespread dissatisfaction in the government of the Azad Hind. There apparently exists a faction of politicians and bureaucrats in the nation who, displeased by the Netajit's reforms (which, according to them, distorted the vision of a free India by bending down to international finance) are allegedly preparing a fronde against Rao himself, possibly supported by Generalissimo Singh's clique of the INA. As the possibility of a coup is beginning to appear on the horizon, Netaji Rao must decide what to do - ignore these baseless rumors, or act preemptively and purge the government from potentially subversive elements?"
 BEN_Lib2_An_IMF_Loan:0 "An IMF Loan?"
 BEN_Lib2_An_IMF_Loan_desc:0 "Any liberalizing economy is in desperate need of one particular commodity - liquid cash. Money is what makes the world go round, and financial stability requires liquid solvency. As our country is currently witnessing an economic boom due to Rao's reforms, this would be a great time to ask for a loan from the IMF to ensure that we have enough money to further invest into our country, with the assurance that we will be able to pay back with interest. Many voices within the government are opposed to such a move, as they fear that by taking money from a foreign institution we will become shackled to it, but this could actually be a great boon for our financial situation."
 BEN_Lib2_The_Foreign_Counterculture:0 "The Foreign Counterculture"
 BEN_Lib2_The_Foreign_Counterculture_desc:0 "Foreign countries can truly be miserable places - so much so, that a strong countercultural movement has formed in America and elsewhere. Wishing to escape the tyrannical bonds of capitalist and materialistic society, they seek a more spiritual lifestyle far away from their homes - in the land of spirituality itself, India, and more precisely the Azad Hind. Small communities of western expats, mostly hippies and new age people, dot the country, often resented by natives and only tolerated for the influx of cash they tend to bring from abroad. Many have demanded that Netaji Rao moves to curtail these foreigners and the immoral, offensive attitudes they import in their orientialistic trips - but this decision rests with the Netaji alone."
 BEN_Lib2_The_Christian_Refugees:0 "The Christian Refugees"
 BEN_Lib2_The_Christian_Refugees_desc:0 "When the Azad Hind was established, our government immediately cracked down on Christians in the country - they were viewed as a product of Western imperialism, and were offered the choice to either renounce their faith or be persecuted for it until they did. Over the years, many have fled the re-education camps, and they have gone to neighboring Nepal hoping for safety - where most of them still remain. Now that we are back on our feet as a functional government, we must demand the return of these illegal immigrants to our country so that they can be persecuted for their escape. Hopefully, the Nepali government will comply to our reasonable request to hand over the illegals."
 BEN_Lib2_The_Forward_Bloc:0 "The Forward Bloc"
 BEN_Lib2_The_Forward_Bloc_desc:0 "The All India Forward Bloc, or AIFB for short, was founded in 1939 by none other than Subhas Chandra Bose himself, splitting from the Indian National Congress. While many are still nostalgic of the good old glorious days of Bose, when the AIFB was the uncontested dominator of Free Indian politics, times have changed - and now we can only decry what was an inefficient, corrupt, and sometimes downright dictatorial regime. Netaji Rao has considered outright banning the AIFB in order to truly break from the past and enter a new age - but this move will surely prove controversial."
 BEN_Lib2_Into_the_Next_Decade:0 "Into the Next Decade"
 BEN_Lib2_Into_the_Next_Decade_desc:0 "All of the Azad Hind has been profoundly transformed by Rao's administration, becoming almost unrecognizable from what it was only three years ago. Liberal reforms in social and economic matters have brought sweeping changes - as the Islamic population now feels more welcomed and well treated by the state, numerous Hindus and secular people lament the spread of dangerous political Islamism; as economic liberalization has swept away decades of bureaucratic and governmental control, many complain about the growing inequality in wealth and living standards, which is already worsening the class divide in the country. Rao has no plans to leave the helm of the Azad Hind - but only time will tell if his grand projects will actually continue, or be stopped short."

 benintro.1.a:0 "Tell me more!"
 
 benintro.2.t:0 "Once Upon a Time in the East"
 benintro.2.desc:0 "Since the peace, the Azad Hind has been far from peaceful. Bose and the rest of the Azad Hind Government, in their attempts to completely depart from the ways of the British, made a new penal code completely from scratch. This penal code was far more progressive than the old British Indian one, including such things as legalisation of homosexuality and general avant-garde policies. Moving against this, Abul A'la Maududi, leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami, rose up with his calls for Jihad against the socialist Azad Hind Government. Although many Bengalis followed his lead and rose up, their relatively unorganised "Mukti Bahini", or freedom fighters, proved to be no match for the INA, and the rebellion ended when Maududi fled to West India in 1955.\n\nAfterwards, general and the maverick of the INA, Mohan Singh, requested the establishment of a military occupational authority over East Bengal province in an attempt to make sure that another rebellion would never happen again. With Mohammed Zaman Kiani's approval, he established the Military Authority East Bengal, effectively establishing a military dictatorship in the province. Under Singh's rule, the MAEC would begin to imprison Bengali Muslims and put them in internment camps, with the intent of completely eradicating Islam from the eastern reaches of the Azad Hind.\n\nMeanwhile, in Calcutta, things began to change. Bose allowed V. K. Krishna Menon, his personal secretary, a greater hand in organising the government. With this power vested in him, Menon established a two-party system between the big-tent All India Forward Bloc and the authoritarian, moderately-leftist Indian National Army. Since then, Bose has run what amounts to a dictatorship.\n\nHowever, things are changing once again. The Bengalis are rioting for independence, and Indians are rioting for democracy. Things can not continue, and even Bose sees that. However, is it still soon enough to save India, or is it too little, too late?"
 benintro.2.a:0 "Jai Hind!"
 
 bengal.3.t:0 "Army Men"
 bengal.3.desc:0 "While India officially is a democratic republic, there are only two legal parties, and both are in the All India Forward Coalition. The first, the All India Forward Bloc, is the party of Bose, the Sahgals, Pratap, and many others, stretching across both left- and right-wing ideologies. The second party in the AIFC is hardly a party at all; in fact, it's the Indian National Army. Led by Chief of Staff Mohan Singh, the INA is quite a political entity, being considered a legal political party and primarily right-wing.\n\nHowever, with the Netaji likely to pass soon, the possibility of the INA snatching power from the democratic forces at play becomes more and more likely in Bose's mind. So, there are two choices; to either keep the members of the INA in our cabinet around and hope that democracy sorts itself out, or to remove them from their offices and replace them with friendlier faces. This would devastate the coalition, but, as the INA only controls a small minority of Congress, it wouldn't do any significant harm to our government. What will our decision be?"
 bengal.3.a:0 "There is no place for the army in our cabinet."
 bengal.3.a.tt:0 "This will remove §YGurbaksh Singh Dhillon§!, §YShah Nawaz Khan§!, and §YMohan Singh§! from the cabinet, and replace them with §YVijaya Lakshmi Pandit§!, §YJagdish Bhagwati§!, and §YV. K. Krishna Menon§!."

By protocol of the Constitution of Free India, as I am sure you, its author, well know, the Deputy Netaji, who is, in this case, Mrs. Sahgal, serves as the interim Netaji if the current office-holder is incapable or otherwise unable to serve.\n\nI am also well aware that this is a blatant power grab. I know that you have long sought aspirations to take power in your own right, and that you are banking on the failure of this surgery to take power and "reform" India in your own image and beliefs. To this, I can simply say that under my watch, you shall not, and will not, come to power in this great nation. You may have been one of the first members of the Free Indian Movement, but that does not give you the right to rule!"
 bengal.5.a:0 "Sincerely,\nSubhas Chandra Bose"

 bengal.6.t:0 "A Speech to the People of India"
 bengal.6.desc:0 "My fellow countrymen, and all Indian citizens across the world. I will, within the year, be undergoing surgery in Tokyo to remove my tumour. In advance, I desire to express a few words to you. In the first place, I desire to thank you for the outpouring of support that you have given me on this unfortunate occassion. I feel overwhelmed at this show of affection towards your Netaji-President. I have received many phone calls and letters from you, as well as other direct and indirect messages. And all these messages have given me great joy and satisfaction. You know that I have always been an optimist, but this outpouring of support has far exceeded even my expectations.\n\nIn the coming months, I will go to Japan for my surgery, and I can assure you that I shall return, stronger than ever. I have survived the British, the War of Independence, and our struggle against the imperialist-backed West India. I know, without a doubt, that no tumour will stop me."
 bengal.6.a:0 "Thank you."

 bengal.7.t:0 "The Bengal Problem"
 bengal.7.desc:0 "At once, the streets of Dacca swelled with rage. Men broke store windows, taking everything they could, and using what little they had against the INA. Tear gas canisters were often used, and rubber bullets were quickly phased out in favour of real ones for those who dared to attack the soldiers. Pillars of fire consumed small homes of those who were unlucky enough to be in the crossfire.\n\nAnd then, as suddenly as it started, it ended as the first rays of the sun shined over the horizon. The INA had repelled the Mukti Bahini, but at the cost of many lives. Such is the daily life of the people of East Bengal."
 bengal.7.a:0 "We must put a stop to this!"

 bengal.8.t:0 "The Bengali Man"
 bengal.8.desc:0 "The clock in Dakka strikes 10. The young man looks around - a city filled with many Bengalis. Certainly hardly could tolerate the military's sudden...interest in the Bengali people. He walks upon the tired steps of Ahsan Monjil, and begins to speak. For hours he speaks of the Bengali nation - its rich people and culture, and how, one day, it will be free.\n\nThe clock strikes 10. A Bengali nationalist is in the Dacca prison.

 bengal.16.desc:0 "To our west lies an illegitimate India, mired in degeneracy and enslaved to the west. Several days ago, a squadron of their imperialist fighter planes crossed over the demarcation zone on our border. The appropriate response was to shoot these fighters down. We thought little of it, nothing more than just another threat from Delhi gone wrong. However, the western pretenders do not agree. They claim that the fighters were downed on their side of the border. For our so called mistake, they want reparations from us immediately."

 bengal.27.t:0 "Bose Proposes Banning INA From Elections"
 bengal.27.desc:0 "As Bose got off the plane, all could see that his face was cold and stormy. He was followed by a slow and expressionless Mohan Singh. Both departed the airport without exchanging a single word, and there was apparently no contact between the two for several days. Then, Bose finally made his first appearance before the Congress Ka Wazraa since the removal of his tumor. This was no ordinary visit where Bose gave lip service about his struggle and his future plans. No, today Bose was demanding action.\n\nBose's proposition shocked every deputy present: the INA should be banned from participating in all future elections. His arguments were many: the Army running in politics is a breeding ground for corruption and abuse of power, their behaviour in past elections has been suspicious, their proposed policies were laws and spirit of India, and Singh had showed dangerous power mongering while his own Netaji was fighting for his life. Bose presented the bill, gave his arguments, and departed.\n\nThe congress exploded into chaos seconds after. The INA deputies were beyond furious, and demanded that the bill be struck down before it could even be discussed further. Even many who were usually opposed to the INA were uncomfortable with the bill, saying that it could undermine the democratic process. On the other hand, there were many die-hard Bose loyalists and foes of the INA who could not have asked for a better bill if they tried. They rallied behind it instantly, hoping to take out one of their greatest foes in the government. The congress has been on the brink of anarchy since the proposal, and it remains to be seen what choice they will eventually make."
 bengal.27.a:0 "What an odd turn."

 bengal.28.t:0 "The Congress Ka Wazraa Blocks Bose"
 bengal.28.desc:0 "Though many in the Congress of Deputies were eager to leap on Bose's bill and tear apart the INA, far more were completely against it, and the bill to ban the INA from participating in elections was immediately blocked. Almost all said that it was a clear assault on democracy, a corrupt bill designed to keep Bose in power, and just a generally horrible piece of legislation. There was little chance it could have gone otherwise. Bose himself was clearly fuming after being informed, though the INA would be wise to wait on any celebrations. It is clear the Netaji has something planned. He will not give up this easily."
 bengal.28.a:0 "It was very unlikely to ever pass."

 bengal.29.t:0 "Bose Fails to Bypass Congress"
 bengal.29.desc:0 "After his bill to ban the INA from future elections was blocked by the Congress Ka Wazraa, Bose took the next logical step and attempted to bypass the Congress. Citing threats to the democratic process and a potential emergency, Bose demanded that he be given the powers necessary to go over the Congress and cripple the INA, ending the issue once and for all. However, it seems that this move too has failed, as Bose was denied the far-reaching powers required to completely ignore the legislative body of Free India. Many in the AIFB are beginning to lose faith in the Netaji due to his recent actions, but that will not shake the Netaji. Though his options are dwindling, Bose is obviously not going to give up on this."
 bengal.29.a:0 "Push it through, damn it!"

 bengal.30.t:0 "A Free Nation"
 bengal.30.desc:0 "Our government has seen a kind of chaos and anarchy most western nations simply don't understand. The violence and insanity of war, poverty and terrorism has made us tougher, and we have had to use suppressive and authoritarian means in order to achieve this. The OFN and other so-called "democracies" criticize us for this, but we know that if they were in our shoes, they would have done the exact same thing. And now, under Bose's wise leadership, we've shown them all to be fools.\nJust today, Bose gave a speech to the Congress of Ministers where he announced the end of the era of one-party rule, as a part of a compromise with protestors. "Our nation must show its superiority not just through raw strength, but through virtue and wisdom. It takes an unbreakable will to admit one's faults, and it takes even more to act on change to make up for that. We must come clean with the fact that while one-party rule might have served us well in the past, it is not helping anyone now. A Free India must be actually Free."\nThis speech has marked the slow decline of authoritarian influence within our nation, and we will likely see a transition into a democratic state within our lifetime. The more hardline members of the government won't like this, of course, but their proposals won't save us. The new generation will."
 bengal.30.a:0 "An end of an era."

 bengal.31.t:0 "The Calcutta Spring"
 bengal.31.desc:0 "The Calcutta Spring has seen much in the way of reform and change within our government. Against the whims of Hindutva fascists, Old Guard authoritarians and Japanese instructors, our government has transitioned into a functioning republic, based on the sovereignty and will of the people. Bose is being hailed as a champion of democracy for his support of this movement, and the transition has been far less anarchic than we expected. Hopefully, this means that our government can stand the test of time, and be able to reform and adapt to the people's needs and concerns."
 bengal.31.a:0 "It's springtime for Calcutta - and for India!"

 bengal.32.t:0 "Bose Presents Evidence of Fraud Against the INA"
 bengal.32.desc:0 "In his continuing crusade against Singh and the INA, Subhas Chandra Bose today presented evidence to the Congress Ka Wazraa that the INA was clearly threatening the democratic process through voter intimidation and fraud. The most substantial accusations were of threatening voters, with charges such as INA officers threatening to cut pay for soldiers who did not vote for the INA, using their squads to "protect" voting areas while in reality intimidating voters, and even direct threats to potential opponents.\n\nWhile the evidence was fairly solid, it was thrown out quickly. Though the reasoning was kept vague and largely unspoken, it was clear that the true motivation was that the AIFB commonly used such tactics itself. While using this evidence to take out the INA could help in the short run, it could lead to investigations and inquiries that would damage the AIFB just as much. Defeated yet again, Bose stormed out with a contained fury that only he was capable of."
 bengal.32.a:0 "The Netaji may not ever win this."

 bengal.33.t:0 "Socialists Split from AIFB"
 bengal.33.desc:0 "Bose's coalition, the AIFB, has always been a little unsteady, incorporating everyone from communists to liberals and fascists. It seems that minor instability has finally cracked the coalition. In a press conference earlier today, Lakshmi Sahgal announced that she, along with various other leftist ministers in the government and the Congress Ka Wazraa, would be splitting from the AIFB and forming the Revolutionary Socialist Party. Citing disapproval of the direction Bose has been taking, she declared that she hoped that by abandoning the stagnant and ideologically incoherent AIFB she and her comrades could finally work towards bringing real change and reform to the Azad Hind government and all of Free India. She ended her speech by saying she hoped that Bose would be reasonable, and that the new party could still work with the AIFB in the interests of the people, not the government. It remains to be seen if this first defection is the start of something greater."
 bengal.33.a:0 "That's what democracy's for, I suppose..."

 bengal.34.t:0 "Fascists Depart AIFB"
 bengal.34.desc:0 "Following the splitting of the Revolutionary Socialist Party from the AIFB, many believed that the floodgates had been opened for defectors. They may have been proven right with another wave of defections, this time from the fascists and radical nationalists in the AIFB. Rather than forming their own party, these rightists have instead gotten in contact with the BJS and RSS in West India and formed their own branch. This has also marked a sudden surge of young men signing up to join the RSS and serve in its paramilitary branches, a development which concerns many. RSS and BJS activity in the region has absolutely skyrocketed, and only time will tell what affect this will have on the politics and tensions in our country."
 bengal.34.a:0 "Another one bites the dust."

 bengal.35.t:0 "Thackeray Forms Shiv Fauj"
 bengal.35.desc:0 "The defections just keep coming, this time with political cartoonist and Hindu ultranationalist Bal Thackeray departing with the most harcore rightists in the AIFB to form a new party, the Shiv Fauj. Shiv Fauj is perhaps one of the most radical rightist organizations in the entirety of India, easily defeating even the BJS and RSS in its devotion to Hinduism, authoritarian ideals, and racism and xenophobia. Bal Thackeray's cartoons are well-known and influential across East India, and this decision to abandon the AIFB has brought formerly-dedicated voters of Bose to his new party. It can only be hoped that rationality will eventually prevail over populist racist rhetoric."
 bengal.35.a:0 "Let us pray he never gains power over India."

 bengal.74.t:0 "A Meeting With the Guru"
 bengal.74.desc:0 "Earlier today, L. K. Advani met with one of the most prominent RSS leaders in East India, the guru Rajneesh. Rajneesh is a controversial figure even among the rest of the RSS due to his differing ideas on sexuality, but his great charisma and unique ideology has made him very popular and gathered him a large support base. As a leading figure of the RSS in the Azad Hind, he could be a very valuable ally for the government to have, and Advani had a particular proposition for him.\n\nAdvani requested that Rajneesh directed the RSS to assist the government in suppressing Bengali resistance. The RSS is a huge, well-connected, and well-armed paramilitary organization, and its assistance would be invaluable in keeping order in the region. Rajneesh seemed very open to the idea, and by the end of the meeting a mutually beneficial agreement had been made. The RSS began to mobilize soon after, and the militias have begun to segregate the Bengalis as per the government's wishes. It seems that this is a win-win scenario for us all."
 bengal.74.a:0 "Except the Bengalis, of course."
 
 bengal.131.t:0 "Officer Exchanges With the Azad Hind?"
 bengal.131.desc:0 ""An interesting request from the Azad Hind," the Army Minister said, handing over the telegram to the Prime Minister.\n\n"The current regime in Rangoon has sent a message about an exchange of officers between our militaries.  Presumably, receiving their officers would be a good opportunity to share our own lessons of war with them. It would also allow our liaison officers to evaluate the military and political reliability of our friends in the Indian National Army, presenting a desirable path for considering joint operations in the future."\n\n"However there are those within both the IJA and IJN who have argued against the request, citing 'difficulties ensuring successful cross-cultural interoperability' and other unspecified internal issues.  There are also concerns from the Teikoku Gikai, regarding the expense of bringing in officers from the INA and sending our officers overseas for prolonged periods."\n\n"What's your decision, Prime Minister?""
 bengal.131.a:0 "Let's go and meet their request."
 bengal.131.b:0 "The Army and the Navy are right. We must reject their request."
 
 bengal.137.t:0 "Azad Hind Wants Guns"
 bengal.137.desc:0 ""Prime Minister," the Army Minister began, "the Azad Hind has given us another request."\n\nThe PM sat up and said, "Ah, I see. Well, what is it this time?"\n\n"Guns"\n\n"All right then," the PM said flatly. "Please, have a seat."" and the Army man did sit down. Then the PM asked, "What are the Army and Navy recommendations?"\n\n"Well," he began, "the Navy doesn't object to this. They basically handed this over to us. The Army, however, is divided on the matter. I have men in my ministry who believe that it is all right to give them guns, which we know they need for equipping the rest of their ground forces. However, I also have men who do not want to share the guns of our empire with the Azad Hind. They believe that this would make our duty of supplying our garrisons harder, and that it would force our industry to churn out more in order to meet the shortfall.""
 bengal.137.a:0 "Give the approval for the guns. They need it, and we can give it."
 bengal.137.b:0 "Let's keep the guns for ourselves and the Sphere."
 
 bengal.138.t:0 "Japan Accepts Request for Guns"
 bengal.138.desc:0 ""The Japanese have accepted our request for weapons!" cried out the foreign minister as he entered the room where his colleagues were anxiously waiting for news from Tokyo.\n\nOne of the generals present smiled, jumped up to his feet, and said, "That is great! I can finally give my boys some real weapons!"\n\nThe defense minister added to the joy by saying, "Thank the gods! We wouldn't have to beg any of our neighbors for anything. With the guns, we could stand stronger."\n\nLater, the foreign minister explained to them, "It is a great day for us. Now, the Japanese have just told my representatives that they would begin delivering the guns to our boys later. I just hope they would be willing to listen to us should we ask for more.""
 bengal.138.a:0 "I hope they wouldn't have to. But first of all, we must drink to this achievement! For India!"
 
 bengal.139.t:0 "Japan Declines Request for Guns"
 bengal.139.desc:0 ""Our representatives have just informed me that the Japanese do not wish to share their guns with our military."\n\nThe foreign minister added, a frown on his face, "They told them that it would cause problems for their own military, citing that their garrisons in the rest of Asia would need guns more than we would. Our boys tried to talk to them again, but their Army ministry wouldn't move back to the table."\n\nTo that news, the defense minister angrily said, "The bastards! They could supply their own garrisons, but they couldn't supply our allies! It seems that Tokyo doesn't care for our problems here in Calcutta, especially with the damned Burmese." We will simply have to find guns for our soldiers some other way it seems."
 bengal.139.a:0 "What a shame."
 
 bengal.140.t:0 "Give Bombers to the Azad Hind?"
 bengal.140.desc:0 ""A request has reached us again, Prime Minister." the Army Minister said as he arrived.\n\nThe Prime Minister grunted at the news, and he told his visitor, "Really? From the Azad Hind again?"\n\nThe Army Minister nodded, then told him, "Yes. Their request concerns aircraft, particularly bombers."\n\n"Really?" said the PM, now interested. "Let me see...do you have their message?" "Yes," said the AM, "it's just right here with me." He then handed it over to him.\n\nWhen he finished reading it, the PM said, "Hm. Well, what would the Army and the Navy recommend?"\n\n"The Army recommends that we supply them with bombers, but not too many." he said. Then he looked at the floor, head down, as he said, "However, the Navy seems not to be open to the idea. They suggest that if we supply them, they may grow more reliant on us, drawing away our own supplies."
 bengal.140.a:0 "I understand. I suppose we can give them the bombers."
 bengal.140.b:0 "I'm afraid the Navy is right. The bombers must not be granted to them."
 
 bengal.141.t:0 "Japan Gives us Bombers"
 bengal.141.desc:0 ""Great news for our country has come!" the foreign minister cried out to his colleagues.\n\n"Our Japanese allies have decided, after much discussion in Tokyo, to grant us our very own bombers from their armed forces. Their Army and Navy ministries have both agreed to the request of our representatives, and they promised them that they would release an initial number of their aircraft to us in due time."\n\n"With such a delivery of their aircraft, our military would be able to benefit from striking targets that must be destroyed in support of our men on the ground. Without them, we could probably never achieve such aims."\n\nHe took this opportunity to pause for breath before saying, "It must be our goal to make the best use of these planes once they come to us. Thank Vishnu for their generosity.""
 bengal.141.a:0 "Thank Vishnu, the Japanese, and our good fortune."
 
 bengal.142.t:0 "Japan Keeps Their Bombers"
 bengal.142.desc:0 ""Unfortunate news," explained the diplomat.\n\n"Our Japanese Allies believe that it is not to our benefit nor to their own that we receive stocks of bombers from their armed forces. Despite the best efforts of our representatives to negotiate over the request further, our Japanese counterparts have ignored their calls for fresh talks, and to cease any further requests, have requested them to return to Calcutta."\n\nBefore continuing, he spoke lowly, his next words filled with disdain "It seems we will simply not be able to make due with any more bombers for the moment.""
 bengal.142.a:0 "Rats!"
 
 bengal.143.t:0 "The Traitors Come to Talk"
 bengal.143.desc:0 "A cold voice from the lips of the head of the Foreign Ministry reached the Prime Minister, just as he paid him a visit at his office late at night, "The rumors were just confirmed."\n\n"Just last night, a telegram arrived at my office from Calcutta. It seems that the traitorous Azad Hind wish to talk to us. After I had gone through their...flattery, I see that they really wish to formally speak to us about "normalizing" relations with us."\n\n"I must urge caution regarding this. If news of this leaks out to the public, or to the rest of the government, it could lead to outrage. On the other hand, we can't risk losing face by denying their request for talks, too. It may worsen our relations with them.""
 bengal.143.a:0 "We don't have to tell the people. However, I believe it's time we talk to them. They are not like the dalit."
 bengal.143.b:0 "We don't need to talk to them. They are traitors, and such people are not to be spoken to.""

 bengal.145.t:0 "Our Brothers Reject Us"
 bengal.145.desc:0 "The Republic of India has sent to us an unfortunate reply.\n\nDespite our best efforts to reach out to them in a brotherly manner, they have rejected our offer, and have told us that their Prime Minister is not willing to come to any talks we offered to host.\n\nWhile this is a terrible day for us, it is even more terrible for our citizens as it seems that to them, we are nothing but traitors, condemned to a life without any foreseeable hope of reconciliation or reuniting with our Indian brothers, whom we fought to free from our British masters.\n\nThe world wonders if this would cause us to raise our rifles against our brethren or if they would try as they might to bring us down, just as sinners would be sent down into the depths of Naraka."
 bengal.145.a:0 "A deep blow to our hopes of brotherhood and unity."
 
 bengal.147.t:0 "The New Netaji"
 bengal.147.desc:0 "With the noble resignation of the Netaji, the decision of a successor has come to the All India Forward Council, and, more importantly, Bose himself. There are three major options among the potential future leaders of the AIFB;\n\nFirstly is Anita Bose, daughter of the Netaji. While she has very little actual political experience, she does agree with the democratic socialist policies of the AIFB and the Netaji prior to the Second War of Independence. Along with that, she does carry on the Bose name, although appointing her may be viewed as nepotism.\n\nSecondly is V. K. Krishna Menon, current Vice-Netaji and mastermind of Bose's shift in policy from the Second War of Independence. While he has been cast as, among other things, a "Prince of Terror", and "Bose's Evil Genius", and while he is quite old, he has earned praise as the man who taught the colonialists their place.\n\nFinally is Chitta Basu. While a lesser-known figure, even among the AIFB, he has recently gained a name as a hardline Marxist, promising to bring the AIFB back to its roots as a revolutionary socialist organisation.\n\nNow, Bose will have to make a decision on the next leader of the AIFB. As the leader of the AIFB will be the leader of the country until the next elections, this is certainly an important choice. What does the Netaji think?"
 bengal.147.a:0 "Like father, like daughter! Anita shall take the reins!"
 bengal.147.b:0 "Menon will lead the country!"
 bengal.147.c:0 "Basu will bring the AIFB back to its roots!"
 bengal.147.d:0 "Let the Council sort things out!"

 bengal.148.t:0 "The Young Blood"
 bengal.148.desc:0 "With the resignation of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, his daughter, Anita Bose, has been appointed as Secretary-General of the All India Forward Bloc, and as the second Netaji of the Free India Government. Following her father's pre-war beliefs to the letter, many hardliners and followers of the status quo have criticised her for being too soft, with followers of V. K. Krishna Menon calling her too left-wing, and supporters of Chitta Basu claiming the opposite.\n\nRegardless, Anita has the blood of the last Netaji flowing through her; and she knows how to rule with both the iron fist and the velvet glove. Long live the new Netaji!"
 bengal.148.a:0 "Jai Hind!"

 bengal.149.t:0 "The King of Terror"
 bengal.149.desc:0 "With the resignation of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, it has come as a surprise to few that the Vice-Netaji, V. K. Krishna Menon, has been appointed as Secretary-General of the All India Forward Bloc, and as the second Netaji of the Free India Government. Seen as the architect of Bose and the AIFB's post-war doctrine, both hardliners and liberals have criticised Menon for his conservatism and his international nickname as "Bose's Evil Genius".\n\nRegardless of what those who have strayed too far from the centre say, though, Menon shall lead Free India into a new age, combining the ideas of old and new. Forgoing the velvet glove, Menon knows that one must punish a misbehaving child. Long live the new Netaji!"
 bengal.149.a:0 "Charmer of snakes!"

 bengal.150.t:0 "The Revolutionary"
 bengal.150.desc:0 "With the resignation of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Chitta Basu, a rising start among the AIFB, has been appointed as Secretary-General of the All India Forward Bloc, and as the second Netaji of the Free India Government. A devoted socialist revolutionary, and strongly believing in the idea of a vanguard revolution, it seems that the people of Free India will, ironically, not regain their freedom any time soon. Both supporters of V. K. Krishna Menon and Anita Bose have denounced Basu, claiming that he wishes to transform India into a failed communist state, hardly different from Bukharin's Soviet Union.\n\nHowever, whatever the critics may say, Basu knows that one cannot complete the revolution with silk gloves, and that the people shall build the new India. Jai Hind! Jai Sarvahaara!"
 bengal.150.a:0 "Without a revolutionary leader, there is no revolution."

 ###Sahgal Events##

 sahgal.11.t:0 "Sahgal Exits the Sphere"
 sahgal.11.desc:0 "Bose might have allied himself with the Japanese out of necessity and a belief that Japanese might at least end imperialism in asia, after all they were at war with all the colonial powers in the region at the time of the war. Much had changed since those days though. Now Japan was head of a vast empire of its own, hardly anything like the vanguard of liberation Bose had spoken of. Lakshmi Sahgal, although a long time member of Azad Hind herself, had over time become disillusioned with the Japanese Empire and especially the Co-Prosperity Sphere. To Sahgal, India could never be free if it was so desperately reliant on its allies and benefactors in Tokyo. For all their anti-imperialist promises of freedom and glory for the Free Indians once the Republican pretender was gone, she and many of her supporters were less than convinced. With her election victory, all thanks to the man that had led them into the Sphere in the first place, Sahgal was in the position to finally make the term "free Indian" more than just a platitude.\n\nAddressing the nation from the writer's building in Kolkata, Saghal would proclaim that in order for India to truly be free, it must rid itself of all harmful forgeign influence, regardless of it came from the West or the East. With her words being broadcast all across the nation, every free Indian knew that their new path would be a different, perhaps a more perilous one but one of their own making. It did not take long for word to reach West India or Japan, although their reactions were markedly different."

 sahgal.12.desc:0 "Sahgal's rather public announcement that Azad Hind would be leaving the sphere did not take long to reach Tokyo. The Prime Minister, upon hearing the news immediately sending an appropriate response for this outrageous betrayal. The Japanese had never been happy with Bose's decision to allow elections, and with Sahgal's recent actions, their exact concerns had been realised. It might have been simple enough to simply abandon the competing Indian states to their squabble, but Japan had vested interest in the region. Azad Hind had been for a long time the instrument to pursue said interest, and their victory would grant Japan a pleasant degree of control over the subcontinent for years to come. Now that free india was rebelling against their benefactors, only one thing could be done to rectify Japan's position. Start backing the other side.\n\nIt would be simple enough. Japan had not been at war with West India for a long time, and they would surely be glad to be receiving aid in their conflict against Azad Hind. An envoy would be sent to Delhi to discuss a new era of cooperation between the Republic of India and the Empire of Japan. The Empire would get its due, and it needn't even get its hands dirty. India would be more than happy to do the work for them."

 rajneesh.1.t:0 "Sheela at the Reigns"
 rajneesh.1.desc:0 "Ma Anand Sheela was alone in her office, reading over some papers documenting military spending. Her phone rang suddenly, but she didn't jump. Sheela picked it up before it could even finish its first ring. She listened impatiently. It was some minor administrative issue, far below her. She rattled off a solution faster than most could even hear and slammed down the phone, not even waiting to see if it would be of any use. She knew her solution would work. They always did.\n\nSheela was something of an anomaly. She had been named Rajneesh's secretary because she was talented and quick, but nobody had expected just how quick she would skyrocket through the clique. She was extremely young, and many felt threatened by her. She didn't care in the slightest. She was running this country, from taxes to regulations to budgets, and as long as she did it well she would have the blessing of Rajneesh."

 rajneesh.2.t:0 "Radio Rajneesh"
 rajneesh.2.desc:0 ""And now, citizens of the Enlightened Nation, let us once again calm our spirits, so that they may be ignited once again by the words of our Guru." The radio crackled quietly for a few seconds before the voice of Rajneesh began to speak softly out of the old device. It was a speech that had been aired many times already, but the gathered people listened intently anyways. The subtleties and folding layers within their Guru's messages could take thousands of listens to comprehend. There was always more to learn.\n\nThe radio was always praising the Guru. The complex simplicity... or was it simple complexity? They'd have to listen again to remember. His words were beyond those of any other man's. They came not from his throat, not even from his heart, but from the streams of energy that flowed through the earth and water and trees. Rajneesh spoke not for himself, nor for the gods. When Rajneesh spoke, he was telling the people what they were telling him without the consciousness to even realize it. He was the voice of the people that the people themselves were too earthbound to hear without his brilliant inspiration. He was their guide, not their commander. He was their Guru."
 rajneesh.2.a:0 "Sit and listen, and hear your own soul in harmony with his voice."

 rajneesh.3.t:0 "Welcome to Rajneeshpuram"
 rajneesh.3.desc:0 "As part of Rajneesh's reforms to unify the country and promote his own guiding hand, every city in the nation now bears the "spiritual name" of Rajneeshpuram. The guru explains that this is due to every settlement's inherent status as a religious commune, and as religious communes they should bear the name of their spiritual guide. Speaking to his devoted followers, Rajneesh said: "We are not so different. Every city is really a collection of homes, and a home is not a house. It is where one's spirit resides, where it can feel comfortable every night and every day. It is really a religious thing! All cities are the same in that way, and to name them differently is really just to make another false barrier to divide us all."\n\nWhile in theory all cities now bear the same name, in practice even the government has to make a few concessions. The common people, bar the most devoted Rajneeshees, have essentially ignored the reform and continue to refer to their cities and towns in the same way they always have. New signs and government documents refer to cities as Rajneeshpuram followed by their former name, such as "Rajneeshpuram-Calcutta" or "Rajneeshpuram-Dacca". This is also the policy to be followed when maps of the region are printed."

 rajneesh.4.t:0 "Rajneesh's Rides"
 rajneesh.4.desc:0 "Rajneesh watched, his trademark smile on his face, as the fourth and final car was unloaded from the plane. This one had been extremely hard to find, and even when he had found it it had taken a king's sum to convince the former owner to give it up. Still, as the sleek and gleaming automobile rolled its exquisite tires across the airstrip, Rajneesh knew it had been worth it. This was a Rolls-Royce Phantom III, one of the last cars produced by the company before the fall of England and the end of the brand. So many had been destroyed or seized by American or German generals, and it was from the latter that Rajneesh had gotten this particular beauty. The son of a Wehrmacht general who was much less passionate for luxury cars than his father had been willing to sell, though he was no idiot and demanded a price that even most dictators would choke at. Rajneesh had paid without even hesitating to barter.\n\nThe car was lovingly and caringly driven by the Guru back to his home, to join the rest of the most esteemed vehicles in his collection. His dozens of Ferrari Dinos and 250s were to be kept elsewhere, for there just wasn't room for them here. No, this was the place for classics and rarities. Rolls-Royces were a particular favorite of Rajneesh, as the brand had been discontinued after the war and only rare antiques remained. He ran his hand over his new favorite triplets. With the acquisition of this vehicle, Rajneesh now had one of each of the Rolls-Royce Phantoms, a complete collection. Well, almost complete. He had recently found a seller for the UK version of the Phantom I, which differed slightly from the US version that Rajneesh owned. The price was steep, but nothing compared to Rajneesh's desire for the car. He had forwarded an offer, and soon this collection of his would be completed, and he could move on to another."

 rajneesh.5.t:0 "The New Clique"
 rajneesh.5.desc:0 "Rajneesh's meeting with the Shiv Fauj was really not one he wanted to have. His relationship with them had always been uneasy, especially given their tendency to absorb hardcore RSS members who disapproved of Rajneesh's ideas and attitudes. Still, it was one he felt he needed to have. Sheela was beyond loyal and talented, but it was that to a degree that worried Rajneesh. She was devoted to a degree that sometimes worried the guru. He had not a single doubt in his mind that she would tear out a man's throat with her teeth if it furthered her goals. As long as her goals were supporting Rajneesh, that ruthlessness was a valuable asset, but he couldn't help but worry that one day it would be his throat exposed to her fangs. He had to at least hear out the Shiv Fauj. They could prove to be simply safer and more loyal."

 rajneesh.6.t:0 "RSS Integrated"
 rajneesh.6.desc:0 "After weeks of paperwork and shuffling, the RSS has finally been properly integrated into the official military. Every RSS volunteer is now an official soldier in the army, serving their nation proudly. As one of the largest and best-organized paramilitaries in the world, the RSS had surprisingly little trouble with being reformed into an actual government military force, easing the burden on those who oversaw the process. There is a bit of legal awkwardness to work out with the RSS still existing in the West as technically the same organization, but overall the process was painless."

 rajneesh.7.t:0 "Advani Arrested!"
 rajneesh.7.desc:0 "Late this evening, the home of BJS leader L. K. Advani was stormed by RSS soldiers. Advani was taken completely by surprise and was unable to put up much of a fight. He was unceremoniously dragged out of his home by RSS militiamen wearing Rajneeshee robes and thrown into a car before being driven off to a government prison. His trial is scheduled to occur sometime in the next few weeks, though anyone that thinks Advani has a fair shot is living in a fantasy world.\n\nAdvani's arrest was deemed necessary by Rajneesh due to his prominent voice for conservative views in the BJS. Advani has been a vocal critic of Rajneesh's views on sexuality and spirituality, and he represented a greater threat within the guru's own party of conservatism and outdated ideas. By arresting Advani, Rajneesh has put down the boot and shown that he will not tolerate this dissent within his organization's ranks."

 rajneesh.8.t:0 "The Doctrine of the Neo-Sannyasins"
 rajneesh.8.desc:0 "Rajneesh spoke once more to his followers, as he had spoken hundreds of times before. This time, however, they did not hear him. It was more than that. They felt him. He was speaking directly to them, beyond their skin, beyond their hearts, beyond their minds, deep within them and to the tiny pulsing bit of light within every man and woman. He was the soothsayer to the soul and body alike.\n\nHis doctrine was unlike any other. For thousands of years, in far-reaching corners of the world, it was taught that sex, that most primitive and basic of pleasures, was a sin, a corruption of the spirit. Only Rajneesh had seen the truth. That primitive communion with another was not a corruption of the soul, it was a beautiful expression of two spirits, fleetingly uniting as one. It was not apeish and hideous, it was simple and holy. To engage in intercourse was more than a primal release, it was the most ancient worship of the unity of two souls, and it was to be celebrated and free for all to experience. Only Rajneesh saw the truth, until he shared it for India and the world to know."

 rajneesh.9.t:0 "Rajneesh Proclaims Legal Homosexuality"
 rajneesh.9.desc:0 "Gay and lesbian Indians celebrate in the streets today as Rajneesh has finally proclaimed homosexuality to be fully legal and in fact legally equal to heterosexuality in every way. Speaking in one of his talks to his many followers, Rajneesh said this: "Homosexual intercourse is really just another form of spiritual expression, same as any other sex. I am not a homosexual, it is probably something I will never have interest in, but who am I to tell these people their carnal pleasure, their experience of the soul, is wrong? It is just another way for people to discover themselves and each other."\n\nHe continued in this vein before addressing conservative opponents in a lighthearted manner. "There are a lot of people calling me a devil, saying I am promoting evil, that these people are unnatural. I ask them, how can it be unnatural if nature itself made them this way? Humans are animals, exceptionally bright and spiritually connected beasts of nature but beasts of nature all the same. Their cruelties are as natural as their innocence. Really, these fools should be cheering for this freedom! In places where homosexuality is persecuted and its practitioners killed, that is where the most homosexuals will be! They think 'if the powers hate it so much and people do it anyways, there really must be something there', and it always backfires. All these zealots should be thanking me as much as the people celebrating in the streets are!""

 rajneesh.10.t:0 "A Rajneeshee Worship Ceremony"
 rajneesh.10.desc:0 "The sanyassins sat silently, their eyes closed and their bodies still. Then, after a few minutes, one gave a deep and guttural howl. Every few moments, a Rajneeshee discipile would call out some odd noise or sound. The group began to sway, slowly at first but increasing in speed and intensity as the growls and yelps grew louder and more frequent. Their swaying turned to violent shaking, and their hands began to flail about, caressing or striking nearby members, giving both soft comfort and pain.\n\nEventually, the howls grew constant enough that every person present was yelling or moaning at once, and in that chaotic cacophony they fell upon each other. Their worshipper's robes fell to the ground or were torn off, and the meditation devolved into a primal warzone. The worshippers acted as though they were animals, tapping into deep instincts they had suppressed for so long. In both their anguish and ecstasy, they thought only of the spirit, of the soul, of eternity. They praised their guru in their formless screams, their guide to the endless. They thought of Rajneesh."

 rajneesh.11.t:0 "The Abolition of Marriage"
 rajneesh.11.desc:0 "Rajneesh, in his quest to liberate all Indians from outdated ideas about sex and freedom, has passed on of his most radical reforms yet: the abolition of marriage. He spoke on the subject at one of his many talks: "I have recently managed to complete one of my loftier goals: the abolition of government-sanctioned marriage. Many have been outraged by this, but I must say, I do not see why! I do not condemn long-term single-partner relationships, they are one of many healthy ways for one to express one's sexual nature, and if that is what you and your partner desire then by all means do so. You may even get some priest or guru to tell you that your bond is special, that you are married, it is not illegal to do so! I do have to say, if you require the government to tell you to not have relations with others, then perhaps you don't really want that single-partner relationship, perhaps you are lying to yourself. Express yourself as is best for your spirit, not how some crusty old priest tells you!""

 rajneesh.12.t:0 "A Festival in Rajneeshpuram"
 rajneesh.12.desc:0 "The air was filled with joy as men and women danced down the streets of Rajneeshpuram-Calcutta, singing songs and the praises of their guru, Rajneesh. The Rajneeshees were all draped in lavenders and oranges and saffrons, the colors of their leader and their movement. The common folk were dressed in their browns and blacks, but as the partiers danced and cheered many could not help but rush and join in, where they were welcomed by the spiritualist revelers wholeheartedly.\n\nThe Rajneeshees eventually danced their way to a public park, where they ended their journey and set up their impromptu festival. Banners were put up, grills put out, and fires lit, and soon the smell of sweet and savoury scents filled the air. The Rajneeshees cooked and danced and sang and ate until the sun went down, and continued to celebrate long after. Finally, their numbers began to dwindle as they headed home, most with a new partner they had just met, a few remaining to clean in silence and pray under the night sky."

 rajneesh.13.t:0 "The Immaturity of Socialism"
 rajneesh.13.desc:0 "Rajneesh's position on capitalism and economic theory in general has always been somewhat confusing or even contradictory, as the guru prefers to focus more on spiritual and social matters. However, today he has given a public endorsement of capitalism and has said that the framework of his government will be based more on capitalism than on socialism. He was quoted as saying this: "Socialism is all well and good in theory, but a society must be sufficiently mature in both spirit and mind for such ambitious ideas to properly function, and that maturity has not been reached. Until we do get that far, the market is a better option."\n\nThis comes as no surprise to those familiar with Rajneesh. He has given the same general speech before, and he has always claimed that the maturity required for socialism is a long way off. Rajneesh almost worships consumerism, riding in a different luxury car every single day and owning a massive collection of gold and diamond-studded watches. Few would be foolish enough to think such a man would endorse socialism."
 rajneesh.13.a:0 "Interesting."

 rajneesh.14.t:0 "Rajneesh Denounces Gandhi"
 rajneesh.14.desc:0 "Rajneesh's disdain for Mahatma Gandhi has never been a secret, but in recent public speeches. he has taken special care to emphasize this face. "The man they call the Mahatma, he was a socialist, this is not up for debate. At best he was misguided, and at worst he actively worked to undermine India. What were his teachings? His teachings were to give up possessions and not fight! With that kind of rhetoric, I would not be surprised at all to find that he was a British plant! What more could they ask for than for their subjects in India to be poor and defenseless? I am sure Gandhi was their dream. There is no shame in ensuring your own prosperity, nor in fighting against imperialism. Gandhi misled India about this. I hope to correct it.""

 rajneesh.15.desc:0 "With a massive increase in sex thanks to Rajneesh's reforms, it is only logical that what follows is childbirth. At least, that is how it was in the past, but in modern times there are plentiful methods to prevent birth. Due to this, Rajneesh has ordered a nationwide drive to provide birth control for every citizen. No Indian should be shackled from exploring their spirit by the birth of a child. The first step in this program is to provide condoms publicly for no charge. Every hospital, shrine, and temple is to have free and publicly available condoms for anybody who asks for them. Hopefully, further advances in medicine will allow for more extensive programs."
 rajneesh.15.a:0 "Use protection, everyone!"

 rajneesh.16.t:0 "The New Kids on the Block"
 rajneesh.16.desc:0 "They arrive on jets personally chartered by Rajneesh, catered to and fawned over on their flights. They disembark onto the airstrips, looking around through their designer sunglasses and lugging their thousand-dollar bags. From there, they are driven by one of Rajneesh's personal drivers to one of the dozens of spiritual communes and temples, and there they are given lodging and promise of many, many months of inner discovery, voyaging through the mind, and exploration of the soul. These people are the Westerners, those who have bought into Rajneesh's teachings and traveled from primarily the United States to experience them for themselves.\n\nHowever, while these millionaires and celebrities have made up the bulk of visitors so far, Rajneesh has opened the gate even further and pumped up the budget of international tourist advertising tenfold. Now, any hippie who can afford a plane ticket and a hotel room is booking a flight to Calcutta, to visit one of the spiritual communes Rajneesh has run. Several communes have been established specifically to cater to western tourists and immigrants, and poor locals note with displeasure that their services and facilities are pristine while the slums they are right next to remain tattered and decrepit."

 rajneesh.17.desc:0 "Rajneesh's students settled once again as they listened to their guru wax philosophical in ways no other man ever had. Today, he was speaking of the global movement he had spawned. "You know, I was shown a photograph yesterday. It was of a street painting in New York City, supposedly vandalism, as if any art could be labeled as a defilement. It is just concrete, the artist is doing a favor, not ruining the lovely and immaculate stone grey of the old wall!" His followers all chuckled. "Anyways, as I was saying, this image I was shown, it was of me! Some young person had gone and sprayed my face on to this wall. This really is something to me, it really struck me. My voice in physicality, well, it only reaches as far as this small crowd. Yet, halfway across the world, in a Western city, an American teenager knew of me and wanted my voice to be heard there. And in a way it was! Their art was really something, the expression, the eyes, the way they captured it all, I must say I felt as though I was speaking in the streets of New York to those people through that art. It's not just there, I have become something of a symbol for spiritual revolution everywhere. My ideas, my face, to so many people they mean different things, but most of all to them I mean rebellion. And in honesty, power to them! I encourage their rebellion, rebellion is how youth find themselves. It's how I found myself and my own ideas! Power to their rebellion, power to the youth of the world, power to the counterculture!"

Right over there are the bathhouses, and I must say they are one of my favorite things here. They take elements from both Japanese and Roman bath houses, really the best of both worlds. The walls are all erotic murals, commissioned from an extraordinarily talented young artist from Dacca, she really is something else." Rajneesh smiled. "You shall have to give me her information. I have run into some money and would so enjoy a new mural in my home." The architect scribbled down her info before continuing. "Over here is the fourth Meditation Center. We have created 'love pods', where two worshippers are locked together for around half an hour in very confined spaces. The pods' shapes are designed to guide the worshippers into lovemaking, they encourage the natural form." Rajneesh looked at one of the pods with a raised eyebrow.\n\nAt the end of the tour, Rajneesh looked towards the architect with a grin. "You have surpassed my expectations and then some. This place will not just be a retreat, it will be the very heart of Rajneeshpuram-Calcutta. People from around the world will dream of one day visiting it and seeing it, I know it is true. I can simply not wait until it opens next week." The architect nodded. They both looked back towards the largest building of the massive resort campus.

"Ah, just who I was looking for. Did the offer on that Rolls-Royce in Mexico go through?" Sheela's face was concerned and her voice cool as she responded. "The offer you were going to put forward was too much. I intercepted it and cancelled it." Rajneesh's face fell into an annoyed frown. "What!? Why? It took me a month to find that model!" Sheela remained collected. "The budget is beginning to suffer. We have to cut spending, but even that will not be enough. We have to make money, get the economy going properly."\n\nAt this point, Rajneesh was truly angry. He fully stood up, and while he wasn't shouting he was on the verge. "This is unacceptable, you do not have the authority to do this!" Sheela stood up just as quickly, and she was not afraid of truly yelling. "Yes I do! You gave it to me so I could help you, and that is what I am doing! I am only helping you here. I promise you, as soon as things are back on track we can reach an agreement on a more satisfactory cash flow to you, but for now you will have to settle for your minute fleet of several hundred luxury cars! Do you understand?" Rajneesh, on the brink of exploding, internally forced himself to calm down. Sheela was right, as she unfortunately almost always was. He sighed and sat down. "Fine. Do what you must. We can fix this." Sheela gave a brief nod. "Yes we can." With that, she whipped around, left the room, and got to work."

He is one of the most popular figures in worldwide countercultural movements, and because of that he's rubbed shoulders with some big names. As a guru, he has given guidance to celebrities such as Mike Love and the Grateful Dead, and these people are extremely devoted to Rajneesh. He has called in his favors and requested that they donate money or raise funds for the nation so he can continue to guide people to their truest spirits for years to come. While they did show reluctance, most eventually yielded, and now Rajneesh has secured a decent if temporary source of cash."

This is something Rajneesh has needed to do ever since the economy began to tank and the government turned to less savoury sources to earn cash, and Sheela has finally gotten around to setting up a system to obscure questionable incomes from any potential prying eyes. The scheme is labyrinthine and complex, but that is exactly what it needs to be in order to do its job properly. Money gained from "unofficial" revenue streams is distributed across "official" ones, especially into ones that are hard to properly question and investigate. Countless taxpayers have paid slightly more on their forms than they actually did thanks to Sheela's distribution, and Rajneesh's donations from his personal fortune are continuing at an officially high rate even though in reality they are slowing to a trickle."

She had had a suspicion that Rajneesh's taste for expensive things might put them here, and she had always kept a card in her back pocket in case it ever happened. Now, she was about to play that card and see if anything would come of it.\n\nThe pyramid scheme was designed not to be spread among the people, but instead implanted into the government of West India. Rajneeshee operatives in the government would begin redirecting very small amounts of funds into improperly documented and out-of-sight bank accounts, claiming that those accounts were where money for certain projects would be stored. Over time, the importance of these "government accounts" would grow and spread among the West Indian government, and they would accumulate more and more money as they became less and less suspicious. Then, when they had gathered enough, Sheela would yank out the money and leave the West Indians conned and drained.\n\nThe first operatives had already begun to redirect funds into the accounts, spreading the word and working to increase their importance. Hopefully, soon enough, this risky venture would pay off big."

These accounts gathered millions and millions before they were unceremoniously yanked away, which instantly caused auditors to notice something was off.

"Don't act like an abused puppy. I'm not going to hit you." She reviewed the reports a final time. "In fact, you should be happy you were the one who got to report these to me. This is good. This is very, very good. I might give you a raise or something." The intern was left in shock as Sheela marched off.\n\nShe made her way to Rajneesh's personal office and, as always, almost kicked down the door without knocking. She tossed the reports onto the guru's desk with a smug smile on her face. He read over the papers, but Sheela knew he wouldn't fully get them. She spoke up to explain. "It worked. It worked much better than expected, if I'm being honest. That is no small amount of money we have just earned." Now Rajneesh was smiling. "More money" was a fairly reliable way to get on his good side. "Excellent work, Sheela. You never disappoint." Sheela replied "I know I don't." with a sly grin and departed."

"Oh, stop acting like a beaten child. I'm not going to kick you." Her eyes were cold. "However, the person who gave you these papers to report to me, I could certainly see myself kicking them." The aide gave a forced laugh, to which Sheela responded with more scorn. "It's not a joke. Now, at this point I would recommend leaving with haste before I link you with this failure and have you fired, though to your credit with a face as forgettable as yours it's hard to imagine I'd subconsciously associate you with anything." The aide scurried off, and Sheela was left alone. She sighed again. The pyramid had failed completely. West India had picked up on the scam in mere days and had the undercover Rajneeshees arrested before they could earn a cent.\n\nShe'd have someone else report this to Rajneesh.

Over the years, many psychiatrists and spiritualists have studied under Rajneesh or been a part of the Rajneeshee movement, using especially his ideas on sexuality in their practice and work. To this day, hundreds of them travel from around the world to study or take courses in foreign Rajneeshee outposts, then return to their lives and utilize what they've learned. Now, they are paying us back.\n\nSheela has organized a massive global campaign to work with these professionals and get them back into the Rajneeshee movement once more. In exchange for further support and communication, they will provide payments to the Rajneeshee organization, which feeds directly into the government's funds. This network of global psychiatrists and psychologists should provide a lovely boost to our pockets."
 rajneesh.27.a:0 "It's a win-win!"

 rajneesh.28.t:0 "Opening the Mind"
 rajneesh.28.desc:0 "The black markets of the Azad Hind have exploded with activity, and the government could not care less. Not only does Rajneesh turn a blind eye, Rajneeshees are now some of the most active participants in the criminal trade of the nation, and many joke that crime is a state-owned operation. There is a single reason for this sudden influx of government influence in the underworld: drug money.\n\nRajneeshee drug cartels are now some of the most active in the world, and while they deal in all kinds of brain-addling substances, it is psychedelics that they specialize in. LSD has become especially popular, and a great number of new addicts can now be found on the streets of the Azad Hind, out of their minds and interacting with figments of the imagination. The Azad Hind has also become a major hub for the international drug trade, as the laws are either nonexistent or so rarely enforced as to be essentially so. With the government taking a cut for itself, along with the influx of money into the economy, this has ended up being quite the helpful situation for all involved."
 rajneesh.28.a:0 "Far out, man."

 rajneesh.29.t:0 "A Cure for the Soul"
 rajneesh.29.desc:0 "The sick man collapsed in front of the seer, his family unable to carry him any farther. They pleaded the silk-adorned guru to tend to their brother, to save him from his weakened body. The Rajneeshee, draped in saffron robes, closed his eyes and placed the tips of his fingers against the hot and sweat-drenched forehead of the sick man, and was silent for a few eternal moments. Finally, he opened his eyes. He spoke softly but certainly, not pausing or stuttering once. "This man is not sick of the body. He is sick of the soul. His pathway of life is crumbled and unmaintained, like a bridge about to collapse. Thus he is sickened, for his path in this life is also his path between lives. I can act as his guide and show him the way, and perhaps then he will be saved."\n\nThe man was carried away and placed on a bed. His body was covered in wet rags to calm the blaze within his blood. The Rajneeshee came and closed the man's eyes with his fingertips, then stripped him entirely until all that remained was a single wet rag over the eyes. He ran his hands along the dirty, scarred skin, and began to softly sing an old song. The dying man listened. He recognized the song, though how or from where he did not know. The cool feeling over his eyes and the caressing notes of the song made him drowsy, and soon he fell asleep, a small smile on his face. He never woke up.\n\nThe Rajneeshee smiled sadly and left. He told the family that the man had not been meant to continue in this life, but he would now find his way safely to the next. "You will see him again someday. Perhaps you will be old and grey, and he a mere child, but you will know each other once more, and embrace one another as family. That is what I have done. His body is dead, but his spirit is healed.""
 rajneesh.29.a:0 "Ancient wisdom from his own path lives."

 rajneesh.30.t:0 "Words of the Guru"
 rajneesh.30.desc:0 "Rajneesh's teachings have proven to be popular not just in India. Across the globe, copies of his books are flying off the shelves, the people of the world intrigued and fascinated by these never-before-seen ideas and philosophies. While they are by far most popular in the United States, there are also significant markets in Italy, South America, the rest of the Sphere, and even West India. There are even copies floating around in the black markets of Germania and the rest of Europe.\n\nRajneesh is ecstatic at the success of his books, and to meet the demand for new words of wisdom he has been working extremely hard to produce more. Sheela had the brilliant idea of simply compiling transcripts of speeches and talks he had given and releasing those to the greater world as well, and several of these compilations are set to publish in the coming years and months. All of the profits are going straight to the government, who are making a fair deal of cash from this."
 rajneesh.30.a:0 "Wisdom isn't free."

 rajneesh.31.t:0 "Cutting Back"
 rajneesh.31.desc:0 "Sheela stood up at the podium, straining to meet the microphone. She wasn't the slightest bit nervous, only a bit annoyed. Finally, she reached a good position to speak from, and began to talk. "The teachings of our Guru have changed us all forever. I see it with my own eyes every day: the soul of the nation is not one of fear and resigned routine, but of exploration and celebration. Some, then, will foolishly think that what I am about to tell you contradicts that and undermines it. This is beyond wrong. Though I have come to deliver a message of simpler living, it is not one of less celebratory living. In fact, it is one of further love and enjoyment! Though the time has come for us to reduce our excesses of consumerist living, it is only so that we can come to enjoy each other rather than objects which do not love us back. Celebrate in the streets with your fellows, rather than staying home surrounded by your worthless trinkets! Take the brave step with me, Indians. Learn to live for each other, and live simpler lives.""
 rajneesh.31.a:0 "Not to mention how it helps the economy."

 rajneesh.32.t:0 "The Nationwide Buyback"
 rajneesh.32.desc:0 "Sheela's latest scheme is perhaps her most ambitious, and definitely her most insane. The idea is basic, perhaps a little too much so: buy up excess possessions of all the citizens of Free India in order to both pump cash into the economy and purchase valuable heirlooms and items for far below their actual prices. This plan was decried as completely insane and more importantly non-viable by most high-ranking officials, but with Sheela's direct mandate from Rajneesh there was little anyone could do to stop her.\n\nEverything went slightly less disastrous than they could have, all things considered. There weren't any riots in the streets, and the more devout followers were willing to sell their possessions with only minor arguments. However, there was inevitably tension when families were offered paltry sums for their cherished relics, and in many cases the "buyers" simply had to back off in order to avoid conflict. Still, the harebrained scheme seems to have worked as well as it could have, and Sheela is declaring this a success."
 rajneesh.32.a:0 "Profit by default, I suppose."

 rajneesh.33.t:0 "The Economy Fixed"
 rajneesh.33.desc:0 "Sheela barged in to Rajneesh's office, refusing to knock as always. Rajneesh had come to recognize her purposeful and short footsteps, however, and was not at all surprised. He opened his mouth to greet her but was immediately interrupted by his ambitious secretary. "We seem to be back on course, at least for now. We aren't on the verge of collapse, at least." She sighed. "Of course, this means your personal spending budget has been restored. We will be watching and regulating it more closely this time, but it is yours to do with as you please."\n\nRajneesh's smile was wide enough to be seen through his huge beard. "Sheela, you are a miracle worker! I promise, I will be commissioning a statue of you for the streets of Rajneeshpuram!" Sheela gave a terse smile. Rajneesh leaned back and stroked his beard. "Now that I have my own money back, I would like you to-" He was interrupted yet again by Sheela. "The Rolls-Royce Wraith, 1938 model? The one currently held by some billionaire in Australia? I already put in a very sizeable bid for it and it should be here any day." Rajneesh gave a great laugh. "Sheela, you know me better than I know myself! Alright, go on, I'm sure you have much more work to do. Don't let me distract you.""
 rajneesh.33.a:0 "Great work, Sheela!"

 BEN_elections.1.t:0 "The 1964 Election Cycle Begins"
 BEN_elections.1.desc:0 "Bijay Sherazi woke up right before the crack of dawn. This was an exciting day. The newspaper had hired him just before the election cycle had started, and he had been lucky enough to be tasked with a lot of the coverage. Tracking down and interviewing people, trying to catch them in lies, that was what Bijay was absolutely best at! He knew he had what it took to absolutely destroy those candidates who would do the rightful Indian government harm. He would crush their Nehruist socialist imperialist ideas.\n\nBijay grabbed his bag, put on his hat, and walked out of his apartment into the streets of Calcutta. After a quick stop at a coffee shop to get breakfast, during which he had a heated debate with the server over Lakshmi Sahgal's idiotic ideas and was eventually kicked out, Sherazi made it to the office of his newspaper, the Calcutta Wire. It was a small and nearly failing paper, outshone by the greater ones in the city, but Bijay knew that he would be the one to save it. It was election season, and it was time to roll."
 BEN_elections.1.a:0 "Let's show them how it's done."

 BEN_elections.2.t:0 "The Election: West India"
 BEN_elections.2.desc:0 "Bijay Sherazi had trekked halfway across the city to get to this press conference. It was one of many that had been held recently; after all, it was election season, and getting your ideas across to the people was the most important step in getting elected. He arrived earlier than any other reporter and was forced to wait an hour before anything could happen. Unfortunately that was really the only option for Bijay, as if he didn't show up to get a spot right in the front he could never see anything. The struggles of a short reporter.\n\nAfter the long wait, the candidate finally made their appearance and spoke on recent issues, most notably the status of the illegitimate West Indian government. Bijay furiously took down notes, though a reader would notice that all the remarks and ideas about how to take down and spin the candidate's speech in the margins were perhaps four times as dense as the actual quotes and reporting. The speech came to an end, and the candidate opened up the floor for questions. Bijay shot up faster than an experimental rocket and squealed his question before the other reporters could even react. "You stated that the people of West India are not to blame, only their corrupt leaders. Does this mean you sympathize with the ideas of a socialist-voting liberal collaborationist populace? Are you too afraid of a conflict to take a hard stance on the traitorous government?""
 BEN_elections.2.a:0 "The opposite: war is the only option to ensure the liberation of all Indians."
 BEN_elections.2.b:0 "Slaughtering our brethren solves nothing. Peaceful reunification is my goal."
 BEN_elections.2.c:0 "The situation is uncertain. We must be open to peace but ready for conflict."

 BEN_elections.3.t:0 "The Election: Bhutan"
 BEN_elections.3.desc:0 "Bijay Sherazi's articles had started to gain some real traction among the people of Calcutta. The Calcutta Wire was finally starting to gain traction again, with its sales numbers trending upwards for the first time in years. Bijay was the only driving force behind that, especially his election coverage. He was happy with that.\n\nHe had woken up at midnight today after about half an hour of sleep. He could not afford to rest any longer than that. He had spent the morning hunched over his desk in darkness, typing a scathing article about Bhutan and the various candidate's opinions on it. He revised and revised and revised again, looking for the sharpest debunks and wittiest comebacks to absolutely eviscerate those who would do Bijay's beloved country harm.\n\nWhen the dawn came, he went out to get one more bit of information. He had found out where one candidate typically ate breakfast and intended to go and get an official statement from them. Unfortunately for Bijay, he had been kicked out from this particular establishment after harassing employees and destroying their idiotic ideas with factual evidence multiple times. He managed to sprint past the owner trying to keep him out, and when he reached the candidate he wheezed a question. "Do you..." He gasped and struggled to keep his breath. "Do you think that the justified and reasonable military occupation of the unstable state of Bhutan should continue, or do you believe in going soft on our potential enemies?""
 BEN_elections.3.a:0 "Uh... I guess it should continue."
 BEN_elections.3.b:0 "Sir, I'm eating, but I hope that a peaceful withdrawal from Bhutan comes soon."
 BEN_elections.3.c:0 "What are you talking about? Bhutan is an Indian state and should remain that way."

 BEN_elections.4.t:0 "The Election: Bengali Nationalism"
 BEN_elections.4.desc:0 "The Calcutta Wire had gained enough circulation that finally one of the candidates had agreed to do an interview for the paper. Bijay Sherazi, as the rookie journalist who had made it all happen, was given the privilege of running it. He was more excited than he had been in weeks. No more tracking down politicians, settling for scraps and single-line quotes, literally searching through their old garbage for info. They came to Bijay now, and they would give him information without him having to screech across a botanical garden to get their attention. He was a real journalist.\n\nHe greeted the candidate tersely but politely and invited them to sit. From there, it was no mercy. He pulled out all his hardest questions, his most poignant points, his most deadly arguments. Even as he felt like he should have been dominating, however, he started to feel nervous. The interviewee wasn't flabbergasted and constantly at a loss as he had hoped. In fact, if anything they just looked annoyed. They answered all the questions well and simply brushed aside all of Bijay's carefully crafted "gotchas". Eventually he decided to pull out a real big issue, one that would get other papers talking about this interview. "Bengali nationalist thugs have been committing crimes and destabilizing the nation. How do you intend to deal with this threat?""
 BEN_elections.4.a:0 "I believe there is room for a compromise with the Bengalis."
 BEN_elections.4.b:0 "They are as integral to India as any other and should be treated as such."
 BEN_elections.4.c:0 "The situation is out of control. Military action must be considered."

 BEN_elections.5.t:0 "The Election: The Caste System"
 BEN_elections.5.desc:0 "Bijay Sherazi's interview with the candidate continued. Bijay covered a vast multitude of topics, jumping between them almost as fast as the interviewee could respond. If the candidate ever faltered or seemed even the tiniest bit stumped, Bijay would leap in and focus in on that point, driving it into the ground until even he felt he was going overboard. It made for a good, provocative article, but also a rather tired and annoyed interviewee. The candidate was clerly growing more irritated by the second.\n\nEventually, while talking about another subject, the candidate made a passing reference to the caste system. Bijay saw his chance and pounced yet again. This was the kind of topic that sold hundreds of papers just so that people could read a single line. "Wait, what was that about the caste system? The caste system is extremely important to our faith, culture, and nation. Were you suggesting reforming or dissolving the caste system? That's literally impossible.""
 BEN_elections.5.a:0 "The matter of the caste system is not the government's business."
 BEN_elections.5.b:0 "Well, no, it's an outdated and cruel system that has to be dismantled."
 BEN_elections.5.c:0 "No, I agree, it is an integral part of Indian culture."

 BEN_elections.6.t:0 "The Election: City and State Names"
 BEN_elections.6.desc:0 "The interview was running over time. The candidate was clearly getting very irritated, but Bijay Sherazi would not cede even an inch. He had prepared a list of questions and he would get through every last one of them if it killed him. Unfortunately for him, the interviewee finally had enough. They stood up, gave a very terse and insincere thanks, and got ready to leave.\n\nBijay panicked. He ran his eyes over his list as quickly as possible to try and find one more good question. Everything seemed minor or useless at this point, there was nothing that would corner his target and give a good ending to his article. Finally, in desperation, he just randomly grabbed one issue that he vaguely remembered seeing other candidates making comments on. "Wait! What is, uh, your opinion on the changing of city and state names to their rightful traditional pre-imperialist titles?""
 BEN_elections.6.a:0 "Um... I suppose we should change them."
 BEN_elections.6.b:0 "I guess that should be left to mayors and state governors."
 BEN_elections.6.c:0 "Wha- Who cares?"

 BEN_elections.7.t:0 "The Election: Mercenaries"
 BEN_elections.7.desc:0 "Election day was approaching very, very rapidly. Bijay Sherazi, intrepid reporter and proud centrist, was scrambling. The circulation of the Calcutta Wire was higher than it had ever been before, and that was at this point entirely dependent on Bijay's election articles and coverage. If he didn't pump out new hit jobs, takedowns, and wins every single day, the paper could lose the traction it had fought so hard to get. Bijay would never let that happen. He had a good mind. He was a hero to the paper for all he had done to save it.\n\nThis job in particular had been very hard. He had been tracking down the candidate he had interviewed, trying to get an answer to one more question. He had not been able to get his voice heard at press conferences and certainly could not get an official statement on anything. He had been forced to do it old school. Hiding behind a bush, he jumped out at the candidate as they walked down the street. "Ha! What is your opinion on the amoral and dangerous use of mercenaries in our military!""
 BEN_elections.7.a:0 "Aaah! Uh, they support our soldiers, now get out of here please!"
 BEN_elections.7.b:0 "Whoah! Um, the use of mercenaries is unprofessional, I'm calling the police!"

 BEN_elections.8.t:0 "Election Day"
 BEN_elections.8.desc:0 "Bijay Sherazi was at home on his typewriter. He was working very hard; he was writing three different articles for tomorrow based on who would win. He himself had gone to the polls at four in the morning, waiting for them to open up so he would be the first to vote. He had voted for Singh, of course. He would be happy with anyone except Sahgal, but he had voted Singh because he thought it would make his opponents most angry. He giggled to himself. Those socialists would go off like a gun when they saw their precious Sahgal absolutely destroyed in the polls!\n\nBijay had worked very hard over this election cycle, and it was showing. The Calcutta Wire had gone from a dying paper to one of the most popular among rightists in the city. Bijay was a personality now, and he had publicly debated several opposing activists. He hoped that his hard work had had some influence on the election. Maybe he had changed India for the better. He looked out his window to see the polling place across the street. There was very high turnout for this election. If he had reached even a few of them, he would be happy. He turned around and went back to slamming Sahgal for his article that would be released in the unlikely event that she won. Bijay's work wasn't done yet."

 BEN_elections.9.t:0 "Bose Wins 1964 Election"
 BEN_elections.9.desc:0 "Written by Bijay Sherazi, Senior Editor at the Calcutta Wire\n\nThe polls closed last night with an ominous air, the people of India waiting with bated breath. Could this finally be a new day, a change in leadership? They were soon answered in the coming days with a resounding "No". Subhas Chandra Bose, leader of Free India for two decades now, has renewed his term and shall lead once again. A continuation of the status quo is all the people of India shall have today, it seems.\n\nMany in the nation seem to be gaining an increasingly disturbing sense of apathy as the years pass and Bose continues to lead. Many call him simply too old-fashioned and a few even believe that he may be rigging the elections. Baibhav Shiravadakar, a taxi driver in Calcutta, said: "There's no way a guy like that who'd been in power that long would just risk giving it up. Believe me, he rigged it. It's all rigged. It's all fake. He gave us the illusion of choice so we would accept him again. I would have been fine without it, but I'm getting tired of it to be honest. This stagnation has got us nowhere. We need to see change." Shiravadakar's opinion is shared by countless other Indians. Perhaps their hopes will be realized next election."
 BEN_elections.9.a:0 "Interesting."

 BEN_elections.10.t:0 "Sahgal Wins 1964 Election"
 BEN_elections.10.desc:0 "Written by Bijay Sherazi, Senior Editor at the Calcutta Wire\n\nThe streets run red in Calcutta, not with blood, but with socialist rhetoric and ideology. Lakshmi Sahgal, a candidate that countless Indians hoped had absolutely no chance, has taken the leading position in the Azad Hind government. For so many, this marks the start of a decline, a turn towards misguided socialism and cooperation with the imperialist government in the West. India can only hope that we survive this period of weak leadership.\n\nWhile this writer generally attempts to remain unbiased, I simply cannot in good moral standing go without making my voice heard, as I believe I am the voice of millions of Indians when I say what I am about to say. Sahgal represents only hardship and misguided ideas, a horrible turn for India that none are truly happy with. I have spoken with many on the streets, and even Lakshmi Sahgal voters are saying they did not expect her to win and now regret their choice. I will diligently continue to write throughout this period, and I hope my coverage helps Indians stay informed and make the right choice."
 BEN_elections.10.a:0 "Interesting."

 BEN_elections.11.t:0 "Singh Wins 1964 Election"
 BEN_elections.11.desc:0 "Written by Bijay Sherazi, Senior Editor at the Calcutta Wire\n\nAfter a close race watched eagerly both by our own patriotic citizens and observers around the world, the Azad Hind Fauj headed by Mohan Singh has finally taken a well-earned place of leadership in India. Destroying the competition, Singh soundly defeated stagnant traditionalist Subhas Chandra Bose and misguided socialist liberal Lakshmi Sahgal to earn his office. Indians are celebrating in the streets, joyous to finally have the proper strong leadership to challenge our foes in the West and reaffirm our deep and mutually beneficial place in the Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nIn the opinion of local citizen Prashant Vyas, there is simply no better choice to lead this country. "Singh has the vision and, uh, leadership skills that no other candidate really had. I read about his experience in the Azad Hind Fauj, fighting for our country and against imperialism. It was absolutely crazy and brilliant. There's nobody else I'd want to lead this country." Prashant's opinion is echoed by a good portion of the population, and while there is some discontent from Bengali rioters and rebels, the consensus is that we are in good hands."
 BEN_elections.11.a:0 "Interesting."

 BEN_elections.13.t:0 "The Issue of Regionalism"
 BEN_elections.13.desc:0 "The Polish leader Josef Pilsudski once remarked that his own country was a "home of nations"; that it was a country without the traditional makings of a nation-state, but instead made up of numerous cultural and religious groups which would be bound together by a common culture and sense of identity. India is similarly a "home of nations", and our government will need to decide how to deal with that.\nIn India, we have the issue of Orissa, Bangladesh, Assam, Bihar, and numerous other smaller subsections within these nations. Many of the people living within them want independence, and a few have even used violent means in an attempt to obtain this. The ways to solve this are as follows.\n\nOne, we can try to carefully negotiate and work to meet in the middle with the more peaceful proponents of independence. They are nationalists just like us, after all; surely, we can see eye to eye? Second, we can even try to promote these nationalists and support their claims. It would ensure that we are on good terms with any nation that arises, although we would lose manpower, industry and credibility within nationalist circles. Finally, we can go against all of that and just do whatever we can to suppress these groups. It would be quite brutal and awful, but it's an easy way to ensure that India remains united. What's your decision?"
 BEN_elections.13.a:0 "Let's negotiate; we need to protect the peace."
 BEN_elections.13.b:0 "These are admirable men; let us praise them!"
 BEN_elections.13.c:0 "India shall remain where it is, and any threat shall be vanquished."

 BEN_elections.14.t:0 "The Indonesian War"
 BEN_elections.14.desc:0 "The Asian continent has never truly been content with the idea of being ruled by foreign powers. Be they English, French, Dutch or Portugese, the two world wars sparked a rise in patriotic fighters using any means necessary to overthrow them. It also seems like this hasn't changed a bit with Japanese imperialism; the Pan-Asian rhetoric has not stopped many from realizing that the Empire of Japan is, well, an empire.\n\nThe Indonesian people, like many other groups granted freedom by the Empire, fought long and hard to overthrow their Dutch overlords. The colonial government established there sought to exploit the material wealth of the region, and did so with reckless abandon. By the time Japanese troops began marching through the region, they were met with open arms by the people there, welcoming the right of self-determination. However, this self-determination has been fragile.\n\nBut now that myth of Pan-Asianism is starting to fall away, and the people are in open revolt against their masters. We have three ways we could react to this; we could send an armed detachment to assist them, directly working with the Japanese. We could also send a support staff, and provide medical aid to the wounded and sick in order to help the logistical nightmare that is fighting on those islands. Finally, we could just not do anything; the war is apparently quite brutal in nature, and it's perfectly reasonable to just not involve us in it. The final decision rests on you."
 BEN_elections.14.a:0 "Let's send some men to assist. We need allies against the West."
 BEN_elections.14.b:0 "We don't need to involve ourselves in wetwork to help. Send medical support."
 BEN_elections.14.c:0 "Why should we even care about Indonesia?"

 BEN_elections.15.t:0 "The Law of the Land"
 BEN_elections.15.desc:0 "One of the main problems now facing our administration is the matter of religious law. Our government has previously done well with compromise between factions, but it may be time to change that.\n\nIndia is an incredibly diverse country in many ways, and religion is certainly one of them. Here, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jainists and others all reside and live out their lives as citizens and believers. The Republic had previously promoted a secular policy of tolerance and acceptance of other groups, and while this earned the respect of the left and many religious minorities, nationalists and fundamentalists had no respect for this policy. On the other end of the spectrum is Hindutva; the domination of Hindu ideas and values in every sphere of life. This would earn us the support of extreme conservatives and fascists, but it's unlikely that anyone else would support this.\n\nOf course, the current policy of moderation and balancing the two groups could stay, although we would have to work hard to ensure that both sides stay happy. What's your decision?"
 BEN_elections.15.a:0 "India is a nation of many faiths, and all of them should feel welcome."
 BEN_elections.15.b:0 "Hindutva is our doctrine; all foreign faiths are unworthy of our nation!"
 BEN_elections.15.c:0 "The current policy stays; we shall work with both to achieve our ends."

 BEN_elections.16.t:0 "Our Relations With the Sphere"
 BEN_elections.16.desc:0 "The Azad Hind Government was formed as a direct challenge to the British imperialists and the cruel nature of their colonial government, the Raj. Against both the colonial administrators, their collaborators, and the democrats and pacifists who did nothing to stop them, we rode into battle with the goal of freeing India from all of this. However, we did not fight on our own; first, the Germans gave a home to Free India Radio, and was able to organize captured Raj soldiers found by Erwin Rommel and make them into a mobile army deserving of respect. Then, most controversially, we worked with the Japanese, who gave us weapons, tanks, equipment, and now, political independence from the false government that now rules India.\nThis hasn't been a happy relationship, however. The sight of Japanese soldiers murdering our comrades by the thousand is sickening, even if those comrades are fighting for the liberal republic. Furthermore, those fiends in Afghanistan exploited Japan's desire to break India, and allowed them to conquer rightful Indian land. To say that many within our government resent the Japanese for this is an understatement; plenty are horrified and embarrassed to be seen shaking hands with the men who plunged our fatherland into chaos. Still, one cannot deny that the Sphere has ensured that we are not taken out overnight by the false government or anyone else, and their economic and military aid has been invaluable.\n\nThis brings us the question of how to proceed in our foreign policy; should we become close allies with Japan, continue to affirm our equal status as a member of the sphere, or is a policy of realpolitik towards the Empire more reasonable?"
 BEN_elections.16.a:0 "Japan and India have been allies, and allies they shall remain."
 BEN_elections.16.b:0 "We are to recognized as amongst equals in the Sphere!"
 BEN_elections.16.c:0 "Japan is a tool to be used for our ends."

Mohammed quietly thanked the MAEC for cracking down on all the terrorism that had happened recently.\n\n"Get out of your car," he said, stone-cold. Mohammed could tell well enough that he was a good man, experienced in dealing with things so terrifying as a terrorist. He complied and got out of his car. The officer patted Mohammed down, making sure that he had nothing on his person. Next, he checked the trunk, and found nothing. Moving through each and every compartment, he found nothing. At last, he returned to speak again.\n\n"Present your ID," the officer said, his voice remaining monotone. Happy to show that he was innocent, Mohammed did so, holding it up proud. The officer mumbled to himself for a second before speaking again, saying, "Mohammed Dasgupta, you are under arrest for intention to commit terrorism. You shall be interned at the Old Central Jail until your innocence can be proven via trial."\n\nMohammed could not believe it. He knew it could not have been true. It was a lie. It couldn't have been happening - surely the officer knew he was innocent? He screamed, cried, and begged, but it was no use.
