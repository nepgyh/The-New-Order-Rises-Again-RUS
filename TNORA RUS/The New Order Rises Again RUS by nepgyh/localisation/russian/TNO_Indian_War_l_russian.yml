 indian_war.1.t:0 "An Opportunity Arises"
 indian_war.1.desc:0 "With the news that Azad Hind would be exiting the Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Republic of India found itself in a most beneficial position. Without Japan, Azad Hind would be alone for the time being. This presented an irresistible chance to reunite India and to get rid of a potential proxy for foreign powers to utilise. A private meeting was arranged hastily by the prime minister in immediate response to Sahgal's declaration. From the Prime Minister's office, the assembled ministers quickly reached an agreement that now was the time to strike. It would be too risky to wait longer, the strike would come now while the status of Azad Hind was still uncertain. A call went through to army high command.\n\nFor a long time, the India army had been planning to invade Azad Hind. None of the generals had been sure when they might ever get to try out their plans. When the order came to prepare an attack, everything was suddenly turned on its head as various commanders rushed to dig up every document that they had gathered on the eastern pretender. Despite the slightly chaotic proceedings, a plan was eventually ready to be activated against the East Indians, having been pieced together from the best of their vast stockpile of ideas. It would a massive surprise attack, designed to shatter the unprepared defenders on the border. Before they would be able to realise what was happening, Azad Hind would already be in the process of being overrun. With the plan having been approved and examined by the Prime Minister, it was time to strike."
 indian_war.1.a:0 "They'll never know what hit them!"
 indian_war.1.a.tt:0 "We will begin our war to reunify India in a matter of days."

 indian_war.2.t:0 "Deafening Silence"
 indian_war.2.desc:0 "We thought that our departure from the Sphere would lead to celebration.\n\nThere was no celebration– instead, it lead to silence.\n\nAlong the border between the two Indias, there was a small strip of demilitarised land. Although small enough, it was deadly crossing, laden with barbed wire and tall fences to deter anyone on either side from trying to pass through. As such, the border was quiet, as both sides were too focused on each other to really every relax. With binoculars, they could see each other however, and follow the patterns of each patrol and outpost. One Azad Hind soldier, a particularly watchful fellow, had over his time as a border guard watched his equivalents on the other side performance their routines a few hundred times now.\n\nIt was fair to say that the border guards were deeply familiar with the normal state of affairs, especially those with binoculars. It was early morning when they noticed something was odd. Instead of the usual pairs at each station, whole squads of men seemed to be moving a great deal of the stationed equipment away and onto the line of trucks parked nearby. Once they had finished their task, they boarded the trucks and drove off. The Republic of India had seemingly abandoned its own border. A powerful silence overtook the area, as no one was quite sure how to react. From loud and somewhat wild rush of the soldiers clearing the post, there was now nothing. To the onlooking free indian guards, it was perplexing spectacle. Had a situation developed near the border, that required military aid? Had the country suddenly collapsed into anarchy? Was some sort of attack imminent? These thoughts rushed through their heads, though they did not yet speak. It would seem that the silence had cast a spell over them, and that breaking it would spell certain doom for them all. Minutes passed, and the silence remained until one brave man finally raised his voice to asked what had happened. Before he could receive a proper response, the border shook with the sounds of hundreds of vehicles moving closer and closer."
 indian_war.2.a:0 "The spell is broken"
 indian_war.2.a.tt:0 "A war is coming– a war to reunify India."

 indian_war.3.t:0 "The Final War of Independence"
 indian_war.3.desc:0 "Two decades ago, India was ripped in two.\n\nIn the chaos of worldwide conflict, noble freedom fighters from all across India saw that it was time for India to regain its freedom, and as a nation it rose up against the British. One man, however, had a different vision. He thought that India's best hope for freedom was to cooperate with the new order, not fight against it. That man was Subhas Chandra Bose, and with no other choice in his eyes he made a deal with the Axis powers, promising them a free India amicable to their interests. As the people of India threw off the chains of the West, new would-be masters pushed in from the East with their loyal puppet. They pushed all the way across Bengal before India was able to hold the line. Since then, India has been split apart, and in the wild jungles and crowded cities of Bengal the people still lie under an imperial tyrant.\n\nThat ends now.\n\nThis conflict has been building ever since Bose turned his back on the people of India in favor of collaborating with foreign oppressors. His misguided efforts broke a nation, and those he betrayed are now obligated to fix it. The people of India cannot stand back and watch their brothers and sisters toil under a new master as if the British had never left. It is time for all Indians to be free, not just those who were lucky enough to be on one side of a ceasefire line! The War of Independence will never end until every Indian citizen is free! The struggle will be hard, and we will have to wipe our tears aside as Indian fights against Indian once more, but we will persevere knowing that it is for the good of all of the peoples of the subcontinent. We defeated one oppressor, we can defeat one more! Jai Hind!"
 indian_war.3.a:0 "Do or die."

 indian_war.4.desc:0 "Two decades ago, India was ripped in two.\n\nIn the chaos of worldwide conflict, noble freedom fighters from all across India saw that it was time for India to regain its freedom, and as a nation it rose up against the British. One man, however, had a different vision. He thought that India's best hope for freedom was to cooperate with the new order, not fight against it. That man was Jawaharlal Nehru, and with no other choice in his eyes he sold off India to the imperialist west, promising them a free India amicable to their interests. As the people of India threw off the chains of the oppressors, new would-be masters would only recognize the Delhi Republic while using the Indian people as their loyal lapdogs. They would isolate India and force them to compromise with the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Since then, India has been split apart, and across the subcontinent the people still lie under a capitalist puppet.\n\nThat ends now.\n\nThis conflict has been building ever since Nehru turned his back on the people of India in favor of selling India out to foreign oppressors. His misguided efforts broke a nation, and those he betrayed are now obligated to fix it.

 indian_war.4.a:0 "Do or die."
 indian_war.4.a.tt:0 "To Delhi, and beyond!"

 indian_war.5.t:0 "A Meeting in Kolkata"
 indian_war.5.desc:0 "An envoy from the Azad Hind, a nation at war with their rivals in Delhi, has recently aproached us with a deal– we would send them arms, equpiment, supplies, anything to help them win the war, and they would give us access to their economy.\n\nWith the United States or possibly even Japan speculated to make similar actions on the Indian government in Delhi, this could be a good long-term investment to make friends in the subcontinent."
 indian_war.5.a:0 "If our Indian friends need weapons, then we will give them weapons!"
 indian_war.5.a.tt:0 "We will sign a deal with Azad Hind in Kolkata– we give them what they need, and we will get access to their resources."
 indian_war.5.b:0 "Who cares about India?"

 indian_war.6.t:0 "A Meeting in Kolkata"
 indian_war.6.desc:0 "With the backing of Japan, Azad Hind was making good progress towards its end goal of claiming all of India. When a second superpower offers additional aid, one does not need to consider the prospects for long. Indeed, the German offer to discuss potential aid for Azad Hind was quickly accepted. Within days, a german delegation had arrived in Kolkata to meet with officials from the government there. Of course, the Germans had not made the journey to simply hand over what supplies Azad Hind needed, they wished to receive something of their own to finalise the matter.\n\nMeeting in one of the rooms of the Writer's Building, near the Hugli river, the two parties sat down to discuss what would be on the table. The Germans, who did their best to keep their composure despite the intense heat, presented their offer. Azad Hind would receive arms, support equipment, combat vehicles and an industrial boost in their effort against the Delhi government. In return, Germany would gain access to the relatively untapped Azad Hind market. German companies would get their hands of cheaper materials and cheap labour for their goods, before selling them in the reich itself. Of course, even the Free Indian government knew that the aid did not come from any sort of genuine friendship. No, Germany was merely bolstering the enemy of their enemy's ally. In the event of an Azad Hind victory, Germany would have helped eliminate a major American ally in the region. The Reich was making a long-term investment in Free India.\n\nAfter a lengthy conversation in the humid afternoon, an agreement was finally reached by the two parties and finalised with a deliberately over-animated handshake. The German plan for India was now in motion."
 indian.war.6.a:0 "Clearly, this is just business."
 indian_war.6.a.tt:0 "We will begin to recieve assistance from Germany, and they will get access to our economy."

 indian_war.7.t:0 "The Germans Have Abandoned Us!"
 indian_war.7.desc:0 "Although we have approached Germany with our most generous offers, they have turned us down, stating that they do not want to get involved in our conflicts."
 indian.war.7.a:0 "A true shame."
 indian_war.7.a.tt:0 "We didn't need them anyways."

 indian_war.8.t:0 "German Firepower"
 indian_war.8.desc:0 "With the Germans delegation came their wares of war. While the actual representatives had traveled to India via a series of plane journeys, they had also sent for a shipment of weapons and other equipment to be displayed and demonstrated for the buyers in Free India. Having arranged the more official and undoubtedly dull work in the Writer's Building, the two parties could now move on to the entertainment. As to properly present the acquired weaponry, a demonstration was to be performed at a nearby test site.\n\nOn a platform, situated at a safe distance from the expansive firing range, sat the assembled officials from both countries. For the next hour, they were shown the fullest extent of their purchased armaments. Ammunition was spewed across the field, the ground was blackened by explosives and then shook as the artillery was fired. The Free Indians were more than happy and replied to each weapon display with enthusiastic clapping. Then came the tanks, and the helicopters. The ground shook again from the cannons and missiles, and the spent casings rained down from the helicopter's machine guns. The buyers were certainly pleased. With the demonstration ended, a large delivery was put in, and with that the deal was struck. The German delegates even promised that some more experimental weapons might be thrown in, so that they might be tested in combat against the republican Indians in the coming battle. For Azad Hind, this was more than a good deal, and the prospect of further cooperation was only growing more enticing..."
 indian_war.8.a:0 "Now who has to clean up?"

 indian_war.9.t:0 "It's Not Enough!"
 indian_war.9.desc:0 "As the war dragged on, it was becoming increasingly clear that Azad Hind was going to need to ramp up their efforts to even greater heights if they ever wished to see their flag fly over the entire subcontinent. Even with the extensive aid from Germany, the warmachine was beginning to slow down against the tide of the repbulican armies. These were increasingly desperate times. Supplies were often running low, troops were needed in several places at once and for all their successes, it seemed as if the tide might slowly be turning against the free Indians. Not content to sit back and what their invasion fall apart, military high command arranged a meeting with the highest government officials to find a solution to this most pressing, and potentially disastrous issue.\n\nAfter several hours of stressful and angry back-and-forth between the military and the politicians, they managed to agree that only two courses could be taken to avoid defeat. The path more favoured by the politicians would involve a somewhat desperate global outreach plan. The government would search high and low across the globe to find anyone willing to provide Azad Hind with further aid in their war, regardless of what form that aid might take place. Whether the guns be 20 years old or 2, they would be graciously accepted. The hope was that this might scrape together enough to keep the Free Indian armies in the fight for long enough to strike the killing blow. The other plan, proposed by certain enthusiastic military elements was rather controversial. These generals simply suggested that the military be "let loose" to act as they please. Beyond this basic explanation, the generals said nothing else, secure in the knowledge that their idea was clear enough. It was indeed. "Let loose" meant that the army could act as they saw fit, with no need to concern themselves with proper procedure or international law. It would create a mess, a large and unsavoury mess. It would however, be a rather useful mess. Now they need only choose which path might turn the tide best."
 indian_war.9.a:0 "We will find a solution once we look outwards."
 indian_war.9.b:0 "Drastic times call for drasstic measures."
 indian_war.9.a.tt:0 "We will unlock the ability to plan global campaigns to educate the world on our struggle."
 indian_war.9.b.tt:0 "We will unlock the ability to authorize the usage of more... unsavoury weapons of war.\n\nIt's all in the name of victory, though... right?"

 indian_war.10.t:0 "We Can Be Smarter"
 indian_war.10.desc:0 "The war continues. The Indian National Army has given it their all, but it is not enough. The fight seems to go on forever. The frontlines extend from the Himalayas to the ocean and entire cities lay razed in the path of war. Our high command have been tasked with answering a single dilemma– why haven't we been winning? After many meetings and analyzing of the war, we've decided...\n\n...We've been fighting this war entirely wrong.\n\nWe've been fighting the wars of our forefathers. Guns, planes, tanks, and ships. Our technology has improved and so has our doctrine, but we're not fighting a modern war– we're just fighting an antiquated war extremely well. After this realization, our generals written up a detailed plan that takes lessons from the South African War– the use of chemical weapons. Weapons of mass destruction that effect the human bodies in ways that bullets could never achieve.\n\nOur situation is far too urgent for us to rely on developing our own chemical weapons from scratch. We must find a buyer, and quick."
 indian_war.10.a:0 "We will wield a power that we have never wielded before."
 indian_war.10.a.tt:0 "But great power requires great responsibility."

 indian_war.12.t:0 "White Phosphorus Has Been Delivered"
 indian_war.12.desc:0 "Our supplier has made good on their promise and delivered the requested shipments of White Phosphorus. Within a short period of time, we will be able to deploy this chemical weapon against the imperialist puppets in the west.\n\nWhite Phosphorus was utilised extensively during the first and second world wars. The material can be used as an effective smoke-producing agent, useful for masking troop movements as smoke grenades, ammunition for tank-mounted grenade launchers or fired from mortars and artillery. The substance itself is perhaps better known for its offensive capabilities. When used in this manner, the self-igniting nature of white phosphorus allows it to efficiently burn through cloth, ammunition and skin.\n\nOur armies will make good use of the materials wide range of uses. We will keep our soldiers safe with smokescreens and burn away our enemies with the mortar shells."
 indian_war.12.a:0 "An excellent purchase."

 indian_war.13.t:0 "Agent Orange Has Been Delivered"
 indian_war.13.desc:0 "Our suppliers has once again come through. The delivery of the substance known as "agent orange" has arrived. This is a relatively new substance, and although it has of course been tested before, this has mostly been as a tool for clearing dense jungle for fresh farmland. Some have used it for military purposes however. It is rumoured to have been used in Reichskommissariat Ostafrika to clear vegetation there.\n\nRegardless, it has proved effective and now we have our own supply. By using agent orange on the jungles controlled by the western traitors, we can destroy their greatest source of camouflage. Without the foliage to hide in, they will be exposed to our airstrikes and artillery. Our soldiers will also never need to worry about another ambush from the trees again. With Agent Orange, we can quite literally level the playing field."
 indian_war.13.a:0 "Nowhere for them to hide now!"

 indian_war.14.t:0 "We Have our Napalm"
 indian_war.14.desc:0 "Our supplier's final shipment has arrived. We now have access to napalm in large quantities. This is another material with many potential applications on land and in the air. Napalm is an excellent tool against infantry targets, especially those proving difficult to target via conventional means. The flames burn well, and can cover a wide area with ease. It also burns for longer and sticks to anything it touches with a fierce grip.\n\nOur soldiers can be equipped with flamethrowers to devastate swathes of enemies and to dislodge them from their strongpoints. If the aren't asphyxiated, then flames will do the rest. From the skies, our bombers will paint the jungles with streaks of fire. Not only will it reveal enemy positions to us, it will also burn through most of their structures and men with the same strike. We may even be able to fit large flamethrowers onto our tanks, should we wish to employ more durable methods of "delivery". Another versatile weapon has been added to our arsenal."

 indian_war.72.t:0 "Destruction From Within"
 indian_war.72.desc:0 "There exists today a powerful and potentially dangerous secret service - the Intelligence Bureau. The oldest single intelligence service in the world, it serves to keep hidden enemies out of India, and hidden allies under cover. With the advent of the Cold War and its Indian theater, the IB, formerly used by the British as a counter-terrorist and counter-espionage service, found itself split into two branches; the Domestic Service, taking on the role of the old IB, and the Foreign Services, taking on the role of organizing anti-Sphere insurgents and funding rebels in Indochina and Free India.\n\nToday, as we are amidst a war for the very existence of our motherland, the Foreign Services Chief, Samar Sen (himself ethnically Bengali) has brought forth a document for the government's express approval. The document, termed simply "INTERNAL WARFARE IN FREE INDIA", describes in depth the allocation of funds and arms to Assamese insurgents, to bring in higher echelons of the Free Indian government as double agents for our cause, and to cripple Free Indian industry via strikes in industrial regions. By these methods, we would effectively implode the Free Indian government, and allow us to sweep up the leftovers.\n\nWe have, of course, officially given the green light to Sen's proposals, and the Intelligence Bureau shall find itself in a new form of warfare - not on India's fields and plains, but her offices and factories."
